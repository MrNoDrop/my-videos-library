Long ago there was a demon
fox with nine tails.

00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,470
He could destroy everything he could tsunamis his tail strokes.

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,930

Ehi, Naruto!

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,700
Where are you from, Iruka-sensei?

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,420
What where you were during the lessons?

24
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,720
Listen to me Naruto, you must pass the exmanen.

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,050
You would not have to do this.

26

Ok we will practice again

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,290
Okay.

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,250

37
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,380
Next, Uzumaki Naruto.

38
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,760
This is annoying.

39
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
This is your fault.

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,020

41
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,770

Shit, shit.

46
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,300
You can not go home if
you do not clean it.

47
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,600
Fascinating, like someone at home waiting for me.

48
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,320
Naruto ...

49
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,300

54
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,100
Naruto ...

55
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:40,190
why you smeared the mountain ??

56
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,190

us from the demon who attacked our village.

59
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,920
just so you have it geredt?

60
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:12,720
One day no one forgets the
best hokage was there.

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,440
I will be hokage, everyone
recognized with this city.

62
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,940
But, sensei, I want to ask something.

63
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,740
You want a sign?

No.

67
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,370
This happens when you pass your test,
it shows that you are a worthy ninja.

68
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,750
you are getting one if you succeed, tomorrow.

69
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,960

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,090
Why do not you wear your glasses?

71
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,550

72
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,220

73
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,560
It's so you have to make place for place

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,480

79
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:41,020
Iruka-sensei, he has become faster, why do not just succeed him ...

80
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,860
..However?

81
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:49,990
Mizuki-sensei, he should be able to do it one time.

82
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:55,330
but only Naruto, without knowing
Bunshin he can not Strokes.

83
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,990
I can not let him succeed.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,630

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,840

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,560
The Truant.

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,570

Iruka ...

93
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,120
I must once a word.

94
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,260

96
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:05,270
he really want to become strong, Naruto-Kun.

97
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,980
He had no parents.

98
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,240
But ... I want to
succeed himself.

99
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,740
Well, I have not chosen yet ...

100
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,490

101
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,290

102
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,580

103
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,250
Iruka ...

104
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,880

105
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:41,850

Hokage-sama, we can not sit in would be something!

116
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,020
The verbode parchment is the most dangerous of them all.

117
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,320
if it is used wrong, it goes wrong ...

118
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,820

119
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,370

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,190
Forbidden parchment will be mine!

124
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,830
Ehi, Naruto.

125
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,630
Oh, ah, I am so soon got hold of.
I only learned one technique.

126
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,630
He was training ...?

127
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:47,680
Ehi, it's a technique,

128
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,190
when I first learning I was
successful, right? t?

129
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,310
Who does this tell you?

130
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,610
Mizuki-sensei.

131
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,490
He told me where lay the parchment.

132
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,740
Mizuki did this ?!

133
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,080
Aliens is that you gevonde
this place.

134
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,630
I understand that there are things.

135
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,050
Naruto, give me the parchment.

136
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,390
Ehi, what happened here?

137
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,230
Naruto, give the parchment out !! if
you do something terrible happens.

138
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,110
Parchment is dangerous techniques,
there are prohibited.

139
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,320
Mizuki did you use to get it!

140
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,450
Naruto, Iruka was afraid because
ij have the parchment.

141
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,990
What?

142
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,790
What did you tell it, Mizuki !?

143
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,000
believe him not, Naruto.

144
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,210
I'm telling? the truth.

145
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,090
do not do it!

146
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,130
The incident that 12 years ago there was instead was made a rule.

147
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,220
1 line?

148
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:11,270
Aleen a rule, Naruto, which
you may not know.

149
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,980
only me? what
do you mean?

150
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,190
Stop, Mizuki!

151
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,320
the rule is that we could not tell you that
you are the Demonvos with nine tails

152
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
What?

153
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,500
in other words, you live in the
demon with nine tails ...

154
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,950
... who killed the parents of Iruka
and destroyed the village!

155
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,330
Stop!

156
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,670
everyone knows in the village.

157
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,590
why is it that everyone hates you?

158
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,260
Goddamnit!!!!!!!

159
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,720
damn! damn!
damn!

160
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,510
Naruto ...

161
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,980
no one will ever take!

162
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,980
Iruka has always hated you!

163
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:06,820
Iruka, Naruto is growing up without parents
and anyone hat to him by the incident.

164
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,490
Nobody gave him attention and so did bad things tekrijgen attention.

165
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:18,210
it is important he just want anyone
to know that he exists.

166
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,500
even in ZJN alone will lead
Naruto underneath.

167
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,470
you die !!, Naruto!

168
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,590
Naruto!

169
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,180
waa .. why ...?

170
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,070
because no one liked me.

171
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:56,910
After my parents died, nobody
complimetneerde me more.

172
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,210
I always did stupid
things in class ...

173
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,300
..to get only aandaacht.

174
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,840
nobody would
notice why.

175
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,300
because I was a fool that
i was only an idiot.

176
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,850
it is difficult...

177
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,570
do you, Naruto?
you were alone!

178
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,990
it is hard huh?

179
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,820
I'm sorry, Naruto.

180
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:37,450
I'm sorry, Naruto. you are very much there it suffered.

181
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:45,550
This makes me laugh! Iruka has always hated
you because you killed his parents.

182
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,470
he would only have pekament.

183
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,680
Naruto!

184
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,100
Naruto !!

185
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,860
Naruto will never change!

186
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,440
he will take his revenge
with the parchment.

187
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,900
you have to be faced, right?

188
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,370
the eyes of a demon.

189
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,330
Naruto is not like you.

190
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,960
it will be enough that I killed
Naruto and parchment return.

191
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,840
I'm going after him.

192
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,430
onee he goes away ...

193
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,640
it's not going well.

194
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,230
Mizuki told him the secret.

195
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,100
Naruto is Confuse.

196
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,940
it can save the power
that is in him.

197
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,820
he's ok Forbidden Parchment.

198
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:59,910
it may be that he transforms into the demon fox
with nine tails is low ... but it is possible.

199
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,330
ALSF? done the same ...

200
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,630
Naruto!

201
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,090
the things that was just against
your gezegt Mizuki are wrong !!

202
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,720
Leave the parchment to me! Mizuki want it!

203
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,190
how…

204
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,910
how ... Naruto?

205
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,660
how…

206
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,500
How do you know I'm not Iruka?

207
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,840
because I'm Iruka.

208
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,600
I see.

209
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,390
Why do you protect the one
who killed your parents?

210
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,310
He will murder us and use.

211
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:10,820
You idiot, Naruto is
the same as you.

212
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,070
the same as me?

213
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,950
You can do all those techniques
thanks to the parchment.

214
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:22,660
demon and he would do whatever
he wants with it!

215
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,750
You're right.

216
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,920
I knew it.

217
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,670
Iruka-sensei not accept me.

218
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,290
the demon would do that!

219
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,100
but not Naruto.

220
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,940
Why Naruto ... he's one
of my best students.

221
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:56,950
You should not cut him, he would always be respected.

222
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,450
he will he among leading
his human mind.

223
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,040
He is more than a demon, he's
Uzumaki Naruto Village Leaf!

224
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,750
that's stupid!

225
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,880
Iruka, I'd have to kill you anyway,
it was stupid of me.

226
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,510
you're going to die!

227
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,100
this is the end…

228
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,980
Naruto!

229
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,570
Try it once again to teraken.

230
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,860
I will murder you.

231
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,410
This is not a game, it is no place for a child like you.

232
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,960
porbeerd you use the parchment
to your own will.

233
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,210
it is not a test for us, demon fox!

234
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,760
Taju Kage Bunshin No justsu !!!!!

235
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,690
Naruto ... he made a Kage
Bunshin no jutsu?

236
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,190
He is able to make on real bodies.

237
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,570
what is this…

238
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,070
what's the problem?

239
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,790
heey!

240
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,120
if you do not come back here ...

241
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,910
We come to you!

242
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,350
I think I've dealt with him too hard.

243
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,270
Iruka-sensei, all right?

244
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,470
...

245
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,860
that boy ... he will truly be the hokage ...

246
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,120
Naruto, come here, I want
to give you something.

247
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,540
Has anyone found Naruto?

248
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,620
No.

249
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,290
Shit, no one has it!

250
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,460
it is no longer necessary.

251
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,550
Hokage-sama!

252
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,510
he comes home soon.

253
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,140
Sensei, I can at last open my eyes?

254
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,890
Yes, open your eyes.

255
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,240
This is the success of your exam.

256
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,330
Okay, let's go celebrate and board windows.

257
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,340
Iruka-sensei!

258
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,510
Ouch! you are hurting me!

259
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:13,270
Naruto you become a true ninja

260
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,940
but we have to go to the cabin windows.
