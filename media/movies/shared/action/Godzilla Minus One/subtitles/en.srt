GODZILLA 70TH
ANNIVERSARY PRODUCTION

00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:13,802
ODO ISLAND NAVY DETACHMENT

3
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:16,054
- Let's go!
- Heave ho!

4
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:19,765
Engine normal.

5
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:20,849
Roger.

6
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,353
- Fuel-system checks out.
- Roger.

7
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:33,279
Ensign Shikishima?

8
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:39,119
Tsukuba Naval Air Corps,
Tachibana. Remember me?

9
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:43,748
{\an8}Of course. I am
greatly in your debt.

10
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:49,044
I'm amazed you were able to
land that bucket of bolts...

11
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:51,714
on this Swiss
cheese of a runway.

12
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:54,299
{\an8}You haven't lost your touch.

13
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,098
{\an8}In simulated dogfights, no, but
suddenly, I'm a real kamikaze pilot.

14
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,603
Then be grateful
for the downtime.

15
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:09,691
But it's odd.

16
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:14,529
We've scoured your rig and
can't find anything wrong.

17
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:19,826
What are you implying?

18
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:47,437
I'm on your side. We need
more people like you.

19
00:02:54,444 --> 00:03:00,366
Why obey an order to "die honorably"
when the outcome is already clear?

20
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:58,258
- Get the guns!
- Yes, sir!

21
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,842
- An enemy raid?
- I don't know!

22
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:03,720
- What is it?
- Something big!

23
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,515
A new Yankee weapon?

24
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:13,355
Taki! Taki!

25
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:15,817
- Light the beach!
- Roger!

26
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:30,038
Taki!

27
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,748
What in the hell?

28
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,667
It's Godzilla.

29
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:36,044
- What?
- A local told me.

30
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:39,007
It brings up deep-sea fish.

31
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:41,009
G-G-Godzilla?

32
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:49,891
We're screwed. Take cover!

33
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:52,979
Take cover!

34
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:05,157
What the hell is it?

35
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:06,993
Nobody knows.

36
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,663
- Ensign Shikishima.
- Sir.

37
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:13,708
Can you reach your 20mm gun?

38
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,961
You're our only gunner.
We're just mechanics.

39
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:21,631
But what if it just
makes it angry?

40
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:24,427
A 20mm gun can kill anything!

41
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,721
Hurry before it gets too close.

42
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:29,599
Go! Now!

43
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,851
Go.

44
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,145
Hurry.

45
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:04,175
What's he doing?

46
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:13,267
Now! Fire!

47
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:29,158
It's coming this way.

48
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:32,285
- What do we do, sir?
- Ammo!

49
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:33,871
Fetch the ammo!

50
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,130
You idiot! Don't shoot!

51
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:45,257
Cease fire!

52
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:46,717
Cease firing!

53
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:53,849
Fall back! Fall back!

54
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,184
Retreat!

55
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:01,941
Mr. Tachibana!

56
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:44,650
I'll draw it this
way. Shoot to kill!

57
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:00,518
You guys didn't deserve this.

58
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:12,572
Hey!

59
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:23,082
Everybody's dead!

60
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,836
They're all dead...

61
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:31,424
because you didn't shoot!

62
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,638
Damn it!

63
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,386
You.

64
00:10:18,137 --> 00:10:19,221
Hey!

65
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:06,894
Watch where you're
stepping, man.

66
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:17,780
Is that you, Koichi?

67
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:22,367
Sumiko!

68
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:24,620
How is this possible?

69
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:27,998
Weren't you a kamikaze pilot?

70
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:38,175
You have the nerve
to show your face?

71
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,386
You're a disgrace!

72
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:46,100
Look what happened because
of cowards like you!

73
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:50,938
If you'd all done your duty...

74
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:54,608
my children wouldn't have died.

75
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:06,954
Do you know if my
parents survived?

76
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:16,464
Everybody's dead.

77
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,386
This whole place was
engulfed in flames.

78
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:27,057
Your folks too.

79
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:33,355
My children met the same fate.

80
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:49,121
MY DEAREST SON, KOICHI...

81
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:53,125
"Come back alive," right?

82
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:58,214
That's what you said.

83
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,190
Stop, thief!

84
00:13:16,857 --> 00:13:19,734
Out of my way!

85
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,905
- Move!
- Grab that woman!

86
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,826
- Please!
- What?

87
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:29,620
Get back here!

88
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:34,542
What?

89
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:04,446
Hey!

90
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:10,369
Finally. Where did you go?

91
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:14,205
It's your fault for
sitting out in the open.

92
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:16,041
I would have been seen.

93
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,794
You've been here the whole time?

94
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,592
Yeah, waiting for you
to get up and move.

95
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:27,469
I bet you're hungry.

96
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:32,641
Why didn't you just abandon her?

97
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:34,643
Hey!

98
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:39,940
And leave her in
a place like that?

99
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:43,193
No?

100
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,739
Interesting.

101
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,160
Please don't follow me.

102
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:54,996
Are you going to leave
us to die on the street?

103
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:56,332
I don't care.

104
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:05,214
After you're done,
you're leaving.

105
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,761
Hear that? He's
so mean and scary.

106
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:14,432
Where's your husband?

107
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:16,143
Is he a soldier?

108
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:20,146
Do I look like I'd
have a husband?

109
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:21,315
What?

110
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,359
Whose kid is she?

111
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:28,030
- Does it matter?
- Of course, it does!

112
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:33,744
During the air raids...

113
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:37,456
her dying mother begged me.

114
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,209
So you...

115
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,545
have no relation to that child?

116
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:46,215
Nope. So what?

117
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,761
What are you, stupid?

118
00:15:51,387 --> 00:15:54,514
You're in no state
to care for a baby.

119
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:57,559
You couldn't leave her either.

120
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:04,941
Name?

121
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,530
AKIKO

122
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:13,659
No, I meant you.

123
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,037
Noriko.

124
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:24,628
Why do you dress like
a vagrant? By choice?

125
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:26,879
Well, I'm no harlot.

126
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,966
Don't look insulted.

127
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:33,804
You've got to survive
somehow. Who could blame you?

128
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,395
What about family?

129
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:51,404
HARU SHIKISHIMA -
EIICHIRO SHIKISHIMA

130
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:52,740
Your parents?

131
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:58,370
Yeah.

132
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:03,375
They were killed
in the air raids.

133
00:17:07,546 --> 00:17:09,506
Then you and I are the same.

134
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:29,735
What?

135
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:32,196
No, you can't...

136
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:36,033
stay...

137
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:50,798
Hey!

138
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,593
What's the story?

139
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:59,098
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.

140
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:02,266
The mother and
child you picked up.

141
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:05,103
Think you're some kind of saint?

142
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:06,271
No.

143
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:08,941
They just showed up.

144
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:12,736
If they're staying,
you picked them up.

145
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:19,451
It's a bit late
to play the hero.

146
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:25,124
Count me out. I'm done caring.

147
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:31,296
Wait.

148
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:35,175
Is that girl able to breastfeed?

149
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:42,182
No. She's not the
child's mother.

150
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,309
What?

151
00:18:56,947 --> 00:19:00,283
At this rate, she'll
die of malnutrition.

152
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:01,493
Right?

153
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:07,166
So you found a child, but you
have no idea how to care for it.

154
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,501
What were you thinking?

155
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:11,920
I don't know.

156
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:22,014
It's not for you.

157
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:25,684
Adults can survive on anything.

158
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:33,108
Use it to make rice gruel.

159
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,109
Well...

160
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:38,530
there goes my prized white rice.

161
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,950
What a nuisance, I swear.

162
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:57,466
Damn it. I'm soaking wet.

163
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:05,515
Was there any work?

164
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,852
Well, I did find something.

165
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:11,313
What's the matter?

166
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:15,274
The money's not bad either.

167
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:19,362
Look. They even paid an
advance of 3,000 yen.

168
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:21,531
That's wonderful!

169
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:30,915
It must be a scam, like the rice
you carried that got stolen.

170
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,459
It's nothing like that.

171
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,586
What makes you so sure?

172
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:38,714
It's government approved.

173
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,550
There's a reason
why it pays well.

174
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:42,760
Like what?

175
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:48,725
During the war, both sides laid
thousands of mines in the sea.

176
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:50,686
This is a cleanup job.

177
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:56,275
But the pay is extremely
good because, well...

178
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:03,407
it comes with a
certain amount of risk.

179
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:08,452
What are you, crazy?
You just survived a war!

180
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:10,538
What else can I do?

181
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:14,501
At this rate, we'll starve.
Akiko's life depends on it.

182
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:19,798
I understand that but...

183
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:23,135
This brings in money.

184
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,805
With money, we can even
buy American powdered milk!

185
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:28,806
For that, I'd do...

186
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,810
I forbid you to die!

187
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:41,320
Don't worry. Just because it's
dangerous doesn't mean I'll die.

188
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:45,032
It's not like being
a kamikaze pilot.

189
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,203
And besides...

190
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:55,167
I'll be on a special
boat made to evade mines.

191
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:02,924
This is specially made?

192
00:22:17,064 --> 00:22:19,690
Hey, are you our
new sharpshooter?

193
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:20,691
I'm Shikishima.

194
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:21,610
Sailor?

195
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:22,943
Fighter pilot.

196
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:25,488
What? This guy's useless.

197
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:26,906
You're an ex-airman?

198
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:29,201
Just a military
castoff. Worthless.

199
00:22:30,077 --> 00:22:32,203
Disappointed?

200
00:22:32,204 --> 00:22:34,456
When seeing this boat?

201
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,585
The US and Imperial navies laid
60,000 mines off Japan's coasts,

202
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:44,590
all kinds, but the worst are
the American magnetic mines.

203
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:48,720
Any approaching boat made
of metal sets them off.

204
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:52,640
Ah, hence the wood.

205
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:55,559
The boy catches on fast.

206
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,187
We mostly handle moored mines.

207
00:22:58,188 --> 00:23:02,025
But wood boats are the
best countermeasure.

208
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:05,529
I'm Noda.

209
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,199
I developed naval
weapons during the war.

210
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,827
Boat captain Akitsu
and Mizushima.

211
00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:14,495
"The Kid" and "Doc".

212
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:16,872
I'm not fond of that nickname.

213
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,749
And I'm not a "kid".

214
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,293
You're still green,
so "Kid" it is.

215
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:24,588
I know. I wasn't in the war.

216
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:29,468
This is a mine sweeper, the Shinseimaru.
It's paired with the Kaishinmaru.

217
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:34,598
The mines rise up from the
seabed like balloons on strings.

218
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,394
Between our two boats is
a cable with a cutter.

219
00:23:38,395 --> 00:23:41,148
All we do is clip the mine wire,

220
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,607
and it floats to the surface.

221
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:48,405
Then we fire on it with
this baby, rat-tat-tat-tat.

222
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,365
Take a look.

223
00:24:01,877 --> 00:24:04,086
This one's a bit tricky.

224
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:05,839
May I give it a try?

225
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:07,883
Are you sure?

226
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,435
You have to estimate its position
and account for movement.

227
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,234
Woo-hoo!

228
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:29,653
Nice shot!

229
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:31,489
Same with fighter planes.

230
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,991
Not that I saw any real action.

231
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:35,118
What?

232
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:40,372
You didn't? That makes
me and Shikishima equals.

233
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:43,167
Hardly. You can't fly a plane.

234
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:46,545
If I'd gone to war,
I would've learned.

235
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:49,007
If only it had lasted longer.

236
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,221
You'd better not mean that.

237
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:58,265
No, sorry.

238
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:03,980
You fool.

239
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:36,429
Fire! Fire! Fall back!

240
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:55,782
You all right?

241
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:04,541
Another bad dream?

242
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:13,675
A dream.

243
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:18,513
Right.

244
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:22,017
I was dreaming.

245
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:30,609
Or maybe...

246
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:34,612
you're just a dream.

247
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:37,281
- What's wrong with you?
- Tell me.

248
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:39,408
This is Japan, right?

249
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:42,494
I really did return
alive, right?

250
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:44,748
- I returned alive!
- Stop!

251
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:06,853
Yes, I know.

252
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,730
I know.

253
00:27:10,523 --> 00:27:12,025
I know.

254
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:20,718
Nice place you built here.

255
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:22,428
Worth every penny saved.

256
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:23,513
SHIKISHIMA

257
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,560
Drink?

258
00:28:29,561 --> 00:28:31,896
Oh, why, thank you.

259
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,568
May I take a photo?

260
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,113
- Please don't waste your film.
- That smile!

261
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:43,741
Hold it. Hold it.

262
00:28:43,742 --> 00:28:44,909
Ready?

263
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:48,871
- Thank you.
- Hey, Doc.

264
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:50,831
No coveting now.

265
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:54,543
Of course not. Noriko's
a married woman.

266
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:56,336
Please stop.

267
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,465
I'm not a wife.

268
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:02,719
What does that mean?

269
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:05,971
She just moved in on her own.

270
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:09,267
She had no place to
go, so I let her stay.

271
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,435
And the child?

272
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:15,731
She brought her too.
But they aren't related.

273
00:29:15,732 --> 00:29:19,319
Akiko was orphaned
in the air raids.

274
00:29:20,987 --> 00:29:24,031
- Wow, that's a beautiful story.
- No.

275
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:26,242
It just sort of happened.

276
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:29,913
Daddy.

277
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:34,375
- Akiko.
- What?

278
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:37,796
I told you. I'm not your father.

279
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,090
Shikishima.

280
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:44,886
- Don't say that.
- That's truly harmful.

281
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:50,349
Fate has brought you
together as a family.

282
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,934
Accept it. Embrace it.

283
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:54,729
Make them happy!

284
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,898
Enough!

285
00:29:57,607 --> 00:29:59,359
I don't want that.

286
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:06,533
Why not?

287
00:30:21,923 --> 00:30:24,884
Welcome home. I just
returned myself.

288
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:26,636
What are you wearing?

289
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:31,599
How does it look?

290
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:34,268
I got a desk job in Ginza.

291
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:37,522
But don't I give
you enough money?

292
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:46,698
It's time I stood
on my own two feet.

293
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:51,327
At this rate, you'll
never find a wife.

294
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:58,543
Have you seen how fast
Ginza is rebuilding?

295
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:00,794
This is so sudden.

296
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:03,381
Not for me, it isn't.

297
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:06,467
What about Akiko?

298
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:12,974
What will you do with Akiko
while you are away at work?

299
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:16,728
Sumiko has promised
to look after her.

300
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:22,859
She was very excited, boasting
she'd raised three kids already.

301
00:31:25,612 --> 00:31:28,990
In that case, I
suppose it's all right.

302
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:33,036
Thanks. I'll go get Akiko now.

303
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,955
<i>The colossal sea creature
is projected on a course</i>

304
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:22,502
<i>to reach the Japanese
archipelago within a few weeks.</i>

305
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:28,423
<i>General Douglas MacArthur
stated with regret</i>

306
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:33,845
<i>that recent Soviet movements
prevent US military assistance</i>

307
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:36,431
<i>but called upon Japan</i>

308
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:40,353
<i>to begin strengthening
its security forces.</i>

309
00:32:53,574 --> 00:32:55,243
What did this?

310
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,287
A giant shark?

311
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:00,372
Or a whale?

312
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:03,543
No shark or whale could do that.

313
00:33:04,627 --> 00:33:06,128
A new Soviet weapon?

314
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:08,130
That's not weapon damage.

315
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:09,799
Then what could it be?

316
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:13,094
- An enormous creature.
- Like what?

317
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:16,221
Just admit you have no clue.

318
00:33:16,222 --> 00:33:19,350
I was skeptical
until I saw this.

319
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:22,978
Godzilla.

320
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:26,733
Look there!

321
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:32,154
Floating deep-sea fish.

322
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:34,574
Just like on Odo Island.

323
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:37,242
What did you see there?

324
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:41,997
It was like a prehistoric
dinosaur-turned-monster.

325
00:33:41,998 --> 00:33:46,044
The local inhabitants
called it "Godzilla."

326
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:48,086
Godzilla?

327
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:51,673
Nonsense. You were half
asleep and saw an enemy tank.

328
00:33:51,674 --> 00:33:55,595
Whether you believe me or
not, something wiped out...

329
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:58,556
the entire garrison on Odo.

330
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:00,558
Hold on.

331
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:03,394
I thought the
Americans did that.

332
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:09,232
Odo was never targeted by
US island-hopping forces.

333
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:13,071
It was a repair base
for kamikaze planes.

334
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:15,698
Does that mean...

335
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:18,493
you were a kamikaze pilot?

336
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,460
If this is the same
Godzilla I saw...

337
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:32,048
it must have grown much
larger and more powerful.

338
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:39,388
Hold on a second.

339
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:43,518
Why were we called out
here to begin with?

340
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,480
They don't expect us to
fight that in this boat!

341
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:50,273
Yes, they do.

342
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:53,652
We obviously don't
stand a chance!

343
00:34:53,653 --> 00:34:58,406
That's a US warship! What
can we do in this little rig?

344
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:00,535
Stall for time.

345
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:02,911
Stall?

346
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:06,373
The Takao is coming
from Singapore.

347
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:08,500
The heavy cruiser?

348
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:12,171
Rather than scuttle it,
it's being returned.

349
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:15,382
That's good news!
The Takao's a beast!

350
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:19,261
So we've been ordered
to stall for time.

351
00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:23,640
Why can't the US handle
it? It's their ship.

352
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:26,810
They're worried
about the Soviets.

353
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:30,438
Any military maneuvers
would raise alarms.

354
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:33,733
They'd prefer we
handle the small stuff.

355
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:37,612
This isn't small stuff, and
all we've got is a 13mm gun.

356
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:41,242
I was told to make use
of recovered mines.

357
00:35:41,993 --> 00:35:46,204
Ah, now I see! This is why
they called us out here.

358
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:50,500
Plus, our main weapon has
to be locally scavenged?

359
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:54,671
We're also not allowed to
talk about it with anyone.

360
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:58,176
There it is. Their
favorite gag order.

361
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,596
This country never changes.

362
00:36:02,638 --> 00:36:04,140
Perhaps, it can't.

363
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:15,193
Take a breather.

364
00:36:17,486 --> 00:36:19,071
Thank you.

365
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,616
Don't push yourself too hard.

366
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:25,661
I can't help it.
This is Godzilla.

367
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:32,543
I hear you. When I start
remembering the war...

368
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:35,838
I can't sleep sometimes.

369
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,715
I have to avenge them.

370
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:40,635
But at the same time...

371
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,804
I'm terrified of that thing.

372
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,856
We'll need more than
a pair of those.

373
00:37:00,029 --> 00:37:01,239
What is it?

374
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:23,803
There are way more of these
fish than I saw off Odo.

375
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:29,724
Sound the alarm!

376
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:31,184
Godzilla's coming!

377
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:33,312
Sound the alarm!

378
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,107
So it's coming, huh?

379
00:37:37,108 --> 00:37:39,859
Hey, Kid! Prepare
to drop the mines!

380
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,528
- Roger!
- Man the gun!

381
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:44,322
We can't fight it on this!

382
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:46,908
- We can still flee!
- Agreed.

383
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:49,577
- Doc, stand aft and report!
- Captain!

384
00:37:49,578 --> 00:37:52,122
Kaishinmaru, do you copy?

385
00:37:52,123 --> 00:37:55,292
Get ready to land a big one!

386
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:58,253
<i>We're taking all the
credit for victory.</i>

387
00:37:58,254 --> 00:37:59,629
- You idiot.
- Captain!

388
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,716
If we run, the Takao
will never catch up,

389
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:05,219
and the monster
will head for Tokyo.

390
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:09,097
I don't want to see
it in flames again.

391
00:38:09,098 --> 00:38:11,558
But this boat is
no match for it!

392
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,269
I thought you hated
government orders.

393
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:17,898
With a passion.
But you know what?

394
00:38:18,524 --> 00:38:20,609
Somebody's got to do it.

395
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:40,171
Okay, never mind!

396
00:38:44,383 --> 00:38:45,675
Doc, the engine!

397
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:47,677
I'm working on it!

398
00:38:47,678 --> 00:38:49,305
Shikishima!

399
00:38:50,514 --> 00:38:51,557
Shikishima!

400
00:38:52,558 --> 00:38:54,435
Hurry! Over here!

401
00:38:55,936 --> 00:38:58,396
- Captain!
- I know!

402
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:00,399
- Full throttle!
- Right!

403
00:39:21,253 --> 00:39:23,005
Drop the mines!

404
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:26,049
We'll never make it!

405
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,260
We gotta try something!

406
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:49,239
Now, Kid!

407
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,158
Here goes!

408
00:39:56,914 --> 00:39:58,124
Did we get it?

409
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:06,047
No, we did not!

410
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:08,800
Bad, bad, bad...

411
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:10,051
Shikishima, the gun!

412
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:11,554
Roger!

413
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:20,395
Shikishima!

414
00:40:31,282 --> 00:40:33,325
Completely ineffective!

415
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:40,583
The mouth! What
about in the mouth?

416
00:40:42,418 --> 00:40:46,713
Reel! Reel!

417
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:48,382
Drop it!

418
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:57,640
Mizushima, now!

419
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:58,641
Right!

420
00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:10,112
What? No.

421
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:11,779
No!

422
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:26,212
Get down!

423
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:50,653
Did we get it?

424
00:41:58,744 --> 00:41:59,744
No!

425
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:26,646
The Takao!

426
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:27,773
They made it!

427
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:57,343
Oh, no.

428
00:43:34,923 --> 00:43:35,924
Is it down?

429
00:43:47,436 --> 00:43:48,436
What's that?

430
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:50,833
You're finally awake.

431
00:44:53,085 --> 00:44:54,169
Where am I?

432
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:58,424
A Yokosuka hospital. We
were transported here.

433
00:45:00,008 --> 00:45:02,803
What of the Kaishinmaru
and the Takao?

434
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:10,769
Godzilla.

435
00:45:11,353 --> 00:45:13,980
What happened to it?

436
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:16,691
Whereabouts unknown.

437
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:20,987
It was headed for Tokyo. We need
to sound the evacuation order.

438
00:45:20,988 --> 00:45:24,616
The government is not
telling the public.

439
00:45:25,284 --> 00:45:26,951
Why? We must hurry!

440
00:45:26,952 --> 00:45:29,787
To prevent mayhem and confusion.

441
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:33,750
Are you kidding me? We need
to begin evacuating now!

442
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:36,587
No one will take
responsibility...

443
00:45:37,337 --> 00:45:38,671
for the chaos.

444
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:41,633
Information control
is Japan's specialty.

445
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:52,561
Tell me what happened.

446
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:56,982
It's got nothing to do with you.

447
00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:01,820
What is it that
torments you so badly?

448
00:46:04,156 --> 00:46:08,701
You took me in, saved me, and
we've been together since.

449
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:12,790
But you won't let me into
any part of your life.

450
00:46:19,963 --> 00:46:22,382
If you're carrying
some burden...

451
00:46:23,425 --> 00:46:25,719
I wish you'd share it with me.

452
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:38,982
I'm...

453
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:42,110
someone...

454
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:53,956
who fled his duty...

455
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,878
as a kamikaze pilot.

456
00:47:01,588 --> 00:47:02,588
What?

457
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:04,925
On the day of my sortie...

458
00:47:07,636 --> 00:47:10,013
I pretended my
plane was faulty...

459
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:14,017
and made a detour...

460
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:17,229
landing on Odo Island.

461
00:47:30,242 --> 00:47:31,577
These are photos...

462
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:37,124
belonging to the
mechanics there.

463
00:47:39,668 --> 00:47:43,046
They all perished.

464
00:47:56,643 --> 00:47:57,686
That night...

465
00:47:59,646 --> 00:48:03,108
a dinosaur-like
monster came ashore.

466
00:48:06,695 --> 00:48:07,863
I was asked...

467
00:48:08,655 --> 00:48:11,658
to shoot it with the
gun on my fighter.

468
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:15,996
But I froze up...

469
00:48:21,293 --> 00:48:23,128
and ran again.

470
00:48:24,713 --> 00:48:27,841
When I came to the next day...

471
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:33,305
I found them all dead. People
longing to see their families!

472
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:39,770
The monster...

473
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:44,316
was called Godzilla.

474
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:52,032
The other day, it reappeared.

475
00:48:54,785 --> 00:48:56,536
And once again...

476
00:48:58,789 --> 00:49:01,083
I couldn't do anything.

477
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:12,010
I'm someone...

478
00:49:13,804 --> 00:49:16,264
who wasn't supposed to live.

479
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,314
Listen to me.

480
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:30,903
Everyone who survived
the war is meant to live.

481
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:34,199
- How do you know?
- I just do!

482
00:49:35,158 --> 00:49:38,996
As flames took my parents,
they ordered me to live.

483
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:43,959
So whatever happens next,
I know I must survive!

484
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,628
That has kept me going.

485
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:00,851
I can't.

486
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:07,898
They beckon to me in
my dreams every night.

487
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:10,027
"Hurry and come," they say.

488
00:50:10,861 --> 00:50:14,155
"Why are you still
cheating death?"

489
00:50:14,156 --> 00:50:18,534
It's just a dream, just
ghosts you created.

490
00:50:18,535 --> 00:50:20,871
Maybe it's an illusion.

491
00:50:21,705 --> 00:50:24,833
What if I'm actually
dead already?

492
00:50:26,752 --> 00:50:28,754
I died long ago
on that island...

493
00:50:29,379 --> 00:50:30,756
and lie rotting.

494
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:37,590
You and Akiko are just the
last dream of a dead man.

495
00:50:37,846 --> 00:50:40,389
That must be it! It has to be!

496
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,434
You are alive!

497
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:48,899
You are alive, Koichi.

498
00:50:52,694 --> 00:50:54,321
Can't you feel it?

499
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:11,670
Okay, hold the spoon.

500
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:15,091
Gently.

501
00:51:15,092 --> 00:51:17,135
- Grip it firmly.
- Okay.

502
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:22,682
Good, now stir the broth.
You're doing great!

503
00:51:23,642 --> 00:51:26,394
- There, it's done!
- Yeah!

504
00:51:27,604 --> 00:51:30,231
I added your favorite, radish.

505
00:51:30,232 --> 00:51:32,691
- Radish!
- Taste it for me.

506
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:34,861
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

507
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:39,783
First the soup, then radish.

508
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:53,547
Can I...

509
00:51:56,007 --> 00:51:58,009
put this all to rest?

510
00:52:04,975 --> 00:52:07,144
I'd like to try to live again.

511
00:52:25,996 --> 00:52:28,832
Is that what I think it is?

512
00:52:29,624 --> 00:52:31,751
Hurry and report it.

513
00:52:32,627 --> 00:52:34,211
Hurry!

514
00:52:34,212 --> 00:52:35,213
Yes, sir!

515
00:52:56,026 --> 00:53:00,988
Patrols report the creature is
heading east toward Tokyo Bay.

516
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:03,116
Is it close then?

517
00:53:05,327 --> 00:53:07,328
- What is it?
- I don't believe it.

518
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:08,829
Is it here?

519
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,625
Is that really a living thing?

520
00:53:13,793 --> 00:53:19,256
This is Tokyo Bay Defense, requesting
permission to detonate Zone 4!

521
00:53:19,257 --> 00:53:21,301
It's almost here.

522
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,390
Entering Zone 4!

523
00:53:28,183 --> 00:53:29,559
- Now!
- Detonate!

524
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:33,812
Status?

525
00:53:34,898 --> 00:53:35,732
No good.

526
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:37,983
It had no effect!

527
00:53:37,984 --> 00:53:41,488
Blockade breached! It's
heading to Shinagawa!

528
00:53:42,072 --> 00:53:44,032
And it is gargantuan!

529
00:53:47,118 --> 00:53:48,245
Oops.

530
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:51,373
Thank you.

531
00:54:03,843 --> 00:54:07,263
<i>This is an emergency
news report!</i>

532
00:54:07,264 --> 00:54:11,809
<i>A giant sea creature has
come ashore near Ginza.</i>

533
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:16,523
<i>Those near Ginza, follow police
instructions and evacuate.</i>

534
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:19,401
- <i>This is not a hoax.</i>
- Ginza!

535
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,618
Are you hurt? You okay?

536
00:55:03,194 --> 00:55:04,320
What's going on?

537
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:06,114
What just happened?

538
00:55:23,882 --> 00:55:26,801
Is that... Godzilla?

539
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:50,551
It's a scene that defies belief.
A giant creature on the loose,

540
00:56:50,552 --> 00:56:53,179
trampling Ginza underfoot!

541
00:56:54,514 --> 00:56:57,391
Tearing whole buildings apart!

542
00:56:57,392 --> 00:57:01,770
The Nippon Theater,
beloved icon of the people,

543
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:04,441
is crumbling before
our very eyes!

544
00:57:05,024 --> 00:57:10,320
The Ginza survived air
raids but not this!

545
00:57:10,321 --> 00:57:12,614
This monster has
turned it to rubble!

546
00:57:12,615 --> 00:57:16,660
And now the monster
is coming this way!

547
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:21,832
I can see its enormous head
passing in front of us!

548
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:24,711
It's dangerously close!

549
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,236
Move!

550
00:57:58,912 --> 00:58:00,204
Get up!

551
00:58:00,205 --> 00:58:03,583
- Koichi!
- Do you want to live? Come on!

552
00:58:47,627 --> 00:58:49,003
Did they get it?

553
00:59:31,546 --> 00:59:32,839
This is...

554
00:59:34,048 --> 00:59:35,300
the same as before.

555
01:00:29,562 --> 01:00:30,647
Noriko.

556
01:00:33,107 --> 01:00:34,275
Noriko!

557
01:00:36,569 --> 01:00:38,112
Nori...

558
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:17,586
<i>Damage wreaked by
the giant creature</i>

559
01:02:17,587 --> 01:02:20,630
<i>includes some 30,000
killed and injured</i>

560
01:02:20,631 --> 01:02:24,050
{\an8}<i>and 20,000 homes and
buildings destroyed.</i>

561
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:29,097
{\an8}<i>Recovery operations are underway,
but the path the creature took</i>

562
01:02:29,098 --> 01:02:32,934
<i>carries a risk of radiation
that is impeding progress.</i>

563
01:02:32,935 --> 01:02:38,399
<i>Police have cordoned off central Ginza
to collect shards of the creature</i>

564
01:02:38,983 --> 01:02:44,280
<i>which are of unknown composition
and potentially hazardous.</i>

565
01:02:59,837 --> 01:03:01,547
I'm so sorry.

566
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:08,471
What now for Akiko?

567
01:03:10,515 --> 01:03:13,351
We pull together, that's what.

568
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:15,061
Hey, Akiko.

569
01:03:17,939 --> 01:03:23,069
You like playing with me when
Dad's away at work, right?

570
01:03:23,736 --> 01:03:25,655
Where's Mommy?

571
01:03:31,702 --> 01:03:36,874
Mommy had to go away for
a little while for work.

572
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,961
But you'll have
me with you, okay?

573
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:30,052
You can't forgive
me. Is that it?

574
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:37,894
It's my fault...

575
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,981
for thinking I
could dream again.

576
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:57,955
Mr. Shikishima.

577
01:04:59,457 --> 01:05:05,296
There's actually a strategy being
hatched to defeat Godzilla...

578
01:05:06,714 --> 01:05:08,424
led by private citizens.

579
01:05:09,467 --> 01:05:11,969
It lacks any real basis
for viability, but...

580
01:05:15,306 --> 01:05:16,766
will you take part?

581
01:05:23,314 --> 01:05:26,776
SPECIAL DISASTER
COUNTERMEASURE HEARING

582
01:05:32,365 --> 01:05:35,784
- Wait, everyone here is...
- Yes.

583
01:05:35,785 --> 01:05:38,454
- Ex-navy personnel.
- You're informed.

584
01:05:38,955 --> 01:05:39,955
Really?

585
01:05:58,683 --> 01:06:03,229
{\an8}I'm Captain Hotta, formerly
of the Yukikaze Destroyer.

586
01:06:03,729 --> 01:06:07,190
As you all know,
Tokyo again faces...

587
01:06:07,191 --> 01:06:11,653
an unprecedented crisis.
This time, a monster attack.

588
01:06:11,654 --> 01:06:17,242
But we have no defense apparatus
of our own to protect our people.

589
01:06:17,243 --> 01:06:23,206
{\an8}What's more, any GHQ-led military
action runs the risk of escalating

590
01:06:23,207 --> 01:06:24,750
{\an8}US-Soviet tensions.

591
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:31,632
In short, we must confront the monster
with our strengths as private citizens.

592
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,969
This is why we've
gathered you here.

593
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:39,848
{\an8}But we've negotiated the
use of four destroyers

594
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:42,935
{\an8}originally slated for
handover to the UN.

595
01:06:44,729 --> 01:06:46,230
Are you saying...

596
01:06:46,939 --> 01:06:48,982
you want us back on navy ships?

597
01:06:48,983 --> 01:06:51,444
I saw what it did in Ginza.

598
01:06:51,944 --> 01:06:53,820
There's no way to defeat it.

599
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:58,074
Especially from boats
that have been disarmed.

600
01:06:58,075 --> 01:06:59,409
You're dreaming!

601
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:03,539
That's what I'm here to
explain if you'll allow.

602
01:07:04,123 --> 01:07:05,332
Mr. Noda?

603
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:07,459
The plan...

604
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,589
Pardon me.

605
01:07:12,757 --> 01:07:17,594
The plan was drafted by me, Kenji
Noda, ex-Navy technical officer.

606
01:07:17,595 --> 01:07:19,972
The first thing to know

607
01:07:20,514 --> 01:07:25,310
is that this creature the people
of Odo Island call "Godzilla"

608
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,938
cannot be hurt by
conventional weaponry.

609
01:07:28,939 --> 01:07:34,360
I saw it take heavy artillery
fire from the guns of the Takao

610
01:07:34,361 --> 01:07:36,363
and quickly heal itself.

611
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:40,408
Quiet, please.

612
01:07:40,409 --> 01:07:43,412
So we need a totally
different approach.

613
01:07:45,456 --> 01:07:48,458
Let me give you a demonstration.

614
01:07:48,459 --> 01:07:51,711
This is ocean salinity water.

615
01:07:51,712 --> 01:07:56,883
This wood model is weighted down
just enough to barely float.

616
01:07:56,884 --> 01:08:01,805
What happens if we pipe in freon
gas, enveloping it in bubbles?

617
01:08:01,806 --> 01:08:06,310
That's easy. Bubbles or
not, it would stay afloat.

618
01:08:08,687 --> 01:08:10,272
That's what you'd think.

619
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:18,239
It sinks!

620
01:08:20,491 --> 01:08:24,994
The freon bubbles prevent the
model from contacting the seawater.

621
01:08:24,995 --> 01:08:30,543
My idea is to entrap Godzilla like
this and sink it to the ocean floor.

622
01:08:31,127 --> 01:08:35,296
Did you have any idea
Doc was such a bigwig?

623
01:08:35,297 --> 01:08:36,507
No.

624
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:51,688
At over 1,500 meters in depth,

625
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:56,276
the Sagami Trench is the
deepest place in nearby waters.

626
01:08:56,277 --> 01:09:01,698
The plan is to strap freon cylinders
to Godzilla and let them foam.

627
01:09:01,699 --> 01:09:03,825
We'll create a bubble membrane.

628
01:09:03,826 --> 01:09:08,581
It'll sink so rapidly that
the pressure will crush it.

629
01:09:11,876 --> 01:09:14,336
We'll kill it with
the power of the sea.

630
01:09:15,254 --> 01:09:18,757
That's the outline for
Operation Wada Tsumi.

631
01:09:20,009 --> 01:09:23,804
It's of the sea. Won't it
withstand the pressure?

632
01:09:25,181 --> 01:09:31,181
After 25 seconds, every square meter
will apply 1,500 tons of pressure.

633
01:09:31,729 --> 01:09:37,192
Even ocean-born creatures cannot
bear such rapid pressure changes.

634
01:09:37,193 --> 01:09:38,193
Can you promise...

635
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,488
that would kill Godzilla?

636
01:09:44,033 --> 01:09:47,285
Godzilla is an unknown organism.

637
01:09:47,286 --> 01:09:49,496
We can only predict
what will happen.

638
01:09:53,584 --> 01:09:56,085
But this is our
best alternative.

639
01:09:56,086 --> 01:09:58,380
Will it kill it? Or will it not?

640
01:10:01,383 --> 01:10:03,344
I can't absolutely guarantee it.

641
01:10:05,888 --> 01:10:06,888
Shikishima!

642
01:10:07,306 --> 01:10:08,724
It can be done!

643
01:10:13,979 --> 01:10:14,980
Mr. Shikishima.

644
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:18,150
Hear me out, please.

645
01:10:35,459 --> 01:10:38,337
Now, let's get to the details.

646
01:10:43,175 --> 01:10:47,263
Two ships will corral
Godzilla and wrap it in cable.

647
01:10:48,097 --> 01:10:53,978
The cable will have multiple freon
gas cylinders attached to it.

648
01:10:56,105 --> 01:10:59,525
The gas will be released
as it's being tied.

649
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:04,862
And Godzilla will take a
rapid plunge of 1,500 meters.

650
01:11:04,863 --> 01:11:06,531
What if that fails?

651
01:11:06,532 --> 01:11:08,200
There is a Plan B.

652
01:11:09,493 --> 01:11:12,454
Look into the courtyard.

653
01:11:31,015 --> 01:11:32,141
Inflate!

654
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:40,148
I'm Itagaki of Toyo Balloon.

655
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:41,858
What you just saw

656
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:45,778
is an inflatable flotation
device like the kind...

657
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:47,864
used in navy aircraft.

658
01:11:47,865 --> 01:11:53,203
CO2 is shot into air sacs for
buoyancy, like a life preserver.

659
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:56,998
When Godzilla hits the bottom, we
raise it right back to the surface.

660
01:11:56,999 --> 01:12:00,626
We quickly raise it
back up to the surface.

661
01:12:00,627 --> 01:12:06,627
If it can bear the pressure, it'll then
contend with massive decompression.

662
01:12:07,259 --> 01:12:11,637
I can't say for sure
that it wouldn't survive.

663
01:12:11,638 --> 01:12:14,058
But we must do what we can.

664
01:12:19,396 --> 01:12:22,148
You've all survived
a tragic war.

665
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:27,111
So it pains me to ask you again
to put your lives on the line.

666
01:12:27,112 --> 01:12:30,239
But understand this.

667
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,035
We can't rely on the US
or Japanese governments.

668
01:12:34,036 --> 01:12:37,414
So the future of this
country is in our hands.

669
01:12:40,459 --> 01:12:41,543
I can't do it.

670
01:12:43,587 --> 01:12:45,505
I have a family.

671
01:12:45,506 --> 01:12:48,467
And that goes for
most people here.

672
01:12:49,218 --> 01:12:53,180
Why are we always the ones
drawing the short straw?

673
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,809
We got enough of
that in the war.

674
01:13:03,065 --> 01:13:04,273
Please.

675
01:13:04,274 --> 01:13:07,361
I beg you to listen
very carefully.

676
01:13:08,028 --> 01:13:13,617
This is not an order. You're
all free to leave if you wish.

677
01:13:14,201 --> 01:13:17,621
We have no right to stop you.

678
01:13:41,687 --> 01:13:42,855
This plan...

679
01:13:44,356 --> 01:13:46,358
does it mean certain death?

680
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:48,777
Of course not.

681
01:13:51,196 --> 01:13:54,366
Then it definitely
beats wartime.

682
01:13:57,327 --> 01:13:58,579
It can't be helped.

683
01:13:59,997 --> 01:14:02,039
Someone has to do it.

684
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,709
Who can sail the
ships if not us?

685
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:05,794
- Yeah.
- That's right.

686
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,466
Well, then! Are we in, boys?

687
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:20,142
My friends...

688
01:14:22,519 --> 01:14:23,519
thank you.

689
01:14:24,521 --> 01:14:25,772
Hear, hear!

690
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:38,784
{\an8}What a surprise, to find you're the
mastermind of such a grand plan.

691
01:14:38,785 --> 01:14:41,829
{\an8}Well, I've had a direct
encounter with it.

692
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:44,624
So the task fell to me.

693
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:48,127
And we were called
for the same reason.

694
01:14:48,128 --> 01:14:51,381
Do you think
Godzilla will return?

695
01:14:52,508 --> 01:14:55,593
I think we can
assume that Godzilla

696
01:14:55,594 --> 01:14:58,846
has added Tokyo to
"its territory".

697
01:14:58,847 --> 01:15:03,893
I expect it'll be back within
ten days at the latest.

698
01:15:03,894 --> 01:15:05,144
That soon?

699
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:08,147
You set up
radiation-detecting buoys?

700
01:15:08,148 --> 01:15:11,234
Visual detection isn't enough.

701
01:15:11,235 --> 01:15:15,988
How can you expect it to
walk right into your trap?

702
01:15:15,989 --> 01:15:18,407
- I can't.
- What, no plan?

703
01:15:18,408 --> 01:15:22,329
{\an8}Who do you think I am?
Of course, I have a plan.

704
01:15:24,748 --> 01:15:27,625
{\an8}We have acoustic minesweepers.

705
01:15:27,626 --> 01:15:32,421
We use the speakers to play a
recording of Godzilla's voice.

706
01:15:32,422 --> 01:15:34,549
{\an8}- Its voice?
- Yeah.

707
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:39,137
{\an8}It'll see it as another
territorial competitor.

708
01:15:39,763 --> 01:15:41,681
{\an8}- Hopefully.
- Hopefully?

709
01:15:41,682 --> 01:15:43,516
{\an8}You don't instill confidence.

710
01:15:43,517 --> 01:15:46,727
{\an8}And that flotation device?

711
01:15:46,728 --> 01:15:49,730
{\an8}I can't envision
that working well.

712
01:15:49,731 --> 01:15:51,857
{\an8}Any other ideas then?

713
01:15:51,858 --> 01:15:55,278
I know! We pull it up
with the destroyers.

714
01:15:55,279 --> 01:16:00,784
{\an8}Godzilla weighs some 20,000 tons,
too heavy for two destroyers.

715
01:16:01,785 --> 01:16:02,911
Oh.

716
01:16:03,912 --> 01:16:07,416
{\an8}In short, your plan
is full of holes.

717
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:12,004
{\an8}If you have a better
one, let's hear it.

718
01:16:14,214 --> 01:16:15,299
{\an8}Mr. Noda.

719
01:16:17,259 --> 01:16:20,637
Can you get ahold
of a fighter plane?

720
01:16:21,555 --> 01:16:22,638
Fighter plane?

721
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:27,476
I could anger it with gunfire
and draw it to Sagami Bay.

722
01:16:27,477 --> 01:16:31,023
All planes were decommissioned.

723
01:16:31,648 --> 01:16:35,318
Even if you could,
it shoots a heat ray.

724
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:38,279
You'd risk your life
flying so close.

725
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,323
I'll take that risk.

726
01:16:40,324 --> 01:16:43,618
A fighter plane is
nimbler than a boat.

727
01:16:43,619 --> 01:16:48,040
You're not aiming to
get shot down, are you?

728
01:16:48,832 --> 01:16:50,500
Do you have a death wish?

729
01:16:52,169 --> 01:16:53,169
You're drunk.

730
01:16:53,587 --> 01:16:56,089
You just want to avenge Noriko.

731
01:16:57,174 --> 01:16:58,299
Got a problem with that?

732
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,302
It's too late.

733
01:17:02,471 --> 01:17:05,724
You should've
married her before!

734
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:08,100
You knew how she felt.

735
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:11,104
Don't you think I
wanted that too?

736
01:17:12,022 --> 01:17:14,358
Then why didn't you?

737
01:17:16,109 --> 01:17:17,402
Because...

738
01:17:23,825 --> 01:17:26,286
my war isn't over yet.

739
01:17:51,395 --> 01:17:53,896
- You found a plane?
- Yes.

740
01:17:53,897 --> 01:17:56,108
But it's a unique one.

741
01:18:15,252 --> 01:18:20,298
The short-range interceptor
Shinden was built at war's end.

742
01:18:21,508 --> 01:18:24,009
It was designed to
shoot down bombers.

743
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:26,637
And reach speeds
of over 400 knots.

744
01:18:26,638 --> 01:18:32,017
Its canard design and four
30-mm guns pack a punch.

745
01:18:32,018 --> 01:18:35,439
It's a plane full
of innovations.

746
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:40,359
Only a few prototypes
were field deployed.

747
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:46,360
They were kept here for a
mainland battle that never came.

748
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:51,621
They were left to rust
and are in bad shape.

749
01:18:52,789 --> 01:18:55,207
It's not airworthy as is.

750
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:58,335
What we need is a top mechanic,

751
01:18:58,336 --> 01:19:02,382
someone who knows their
way around a fighter plane.

752
01:19:04,885 --> 01:19:08,555
I know just the person.

753
01:19:11,099 --> 01:19:13,934
{\an8}Ex-Odo Island
detachment mechanic?

754
01:19:13,935 --> 01:19:16,395
- Sosaku Tachibana?
- Yes.

755
01:19:16,396 --> 01:19:19,441
Tachibana.

756
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:23,277
No known current address.

757
01:19:23,278 --> 01:19:27,490
- I see.
- We're swamped with search requests.

758
01:19:27,491 --> 01:19:29,742
This will take time.

759
01:19:29,743 --> 01:19:32,745
I need to locate him urgently.

760
01:19:32,746 --> 01:19:35,623
There's not much more I can do.

761
01:19:35,624 --> 01:19:37,833
- I beg you, please!
- What?

762
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:40,461
The country's future
depends on it!

763
01:19:40,462 --> 01:19:43,631
I'm sure, but I can't
do the impossible.

764
01:19:43,632 --> 01:19:44,549
Sorry.

765
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:46,301
Well then...

766
01:19:46,802 --> 01:19:51,473
where was he posted
before Odo Island?

767
01:19:58,939 --> 01:20:01,357
I've asked everywhere.

768
01:20:01,358 --> 01:20:05,612
But this Tachibana probably
doesn't want to be found.

769
01:20:06,613 --> 01:20:09,365
We can find another mechanic.

770
01:20:09,366 --> 01:20:11,367
Any other leads?

771
01:20:11,368 --> 01:20:13,161
Just wait a bit longer.

772
01:20:14,871 --> 01:20:17,498
Why must it be him?

773
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:21,670
- Godzilla can come at any time.
- It has to be Tachibana!

774
01:20:22,337 --> 01:20:25,006
He's going to get my message.

775
01:20:25,674 --> 01:20:27,342
Please!

776
01:20:53,743 --> 01:20:55,495
Tachibana.

777
01:20:56,788 --> 01:21:00,166
Mr. Tachibana! It's really you!

778
01:21:04,045 --> 01:21:05,881
What's this about?

779
01:21:09,759 --> 01:21:10,844
Wait.

780
01:21:13,263 --> 01:21:17,976
The Odo Island massacre
was all my fault?!

781
01:21:19,853 --> 01:21:21,605
Are you serious?

782
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:23,648
I'm sorry.

783
01:21:24,316 --> 01:21:29,862
I knew if I angered
you, you'd come find me.

784
01:21:29,863 --> 01:21:30,864
How dare you!

785
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,660
The Ginza attack...

786
01:21:36,703 --> 01:21:38,038
was the same as Odo.

787
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:41,082
It was Godzilla.

788
01:21:49,007 --> 01:21:52,927
I need you to repair
a fighter for me,

789
01:21:52,928 --> 01:21:54,930
so I can kill it!

790
01:21:55,722 --> 01:22:00,851
I needed to find you,
to ask for your help.

791
01:22:00,852 --> 01:22:03,730
That's why I wrote
those letters.

792
01:22:05,523 --> 01:22:07,108
Please forgive me!

793
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:14,240
You're on your own.

794
01:22:15,575 --> 01:22:17,619
I'm not helping you.

795
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:21,622
No, wait, Mr. Tachibana!

796
01:22:21,623 --> 01:22:26,418
Please listen to me! I need
your help to kill Godzilla.

797
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:30,423
It's something only you can do.

798
01:22:32,133 --> 01:22:36,845
I exploded a mine in its mouth, and
that hurt it more than a ship's guns.

799
01:22:36,846 --> 01:22:39,683
It's vulnerable from
the inside. You get me?

800
01:22:42,102 --> 01:22:43,228
You don't mean...

801
01:22:44,646 --> 01:22:49,943
I can kill it if I fly a plane
full of explosives into its mouth.

802
01:22:56,866 --> 01:22:58,076
Kamikaze...

803
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:02,455
The war isn't over...

804
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:07,419
for you either.

805
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:14,591
- You got that injury by falling down?
- Ow.

806
01:23:14,592 --> 01:23:18,387
It's swelling up
like a grapefruit.

807
01:23:18,388 --> 01:23:21,390
It's embarrassing,
but I was drunk.

808
01:23:21,391 --> 01:23:23,600
I barely remember it.

809
01:23:23,601 --> 01:23:29,024
I guess you deserved to celebrate
after finding Mr. Tachibana.

810
01:23:30,025 --> 01:23:31,985
A canard, huh?

811
01:23:33,111 --> 01:23:35,655
I'd heard rumors, but
they actually did it.

812
01:23:37,949 --> 01:23:39,867
Mr. Tachibana.

813
01:23:39,868 --> 01:23:42,327
Thank you all for coming!

814
01:23:42,328 --> 01:23:44,497
You're Mr. Tachibana?

815
01:23:48,001 --> 01:23:52,713
So this is the phantom
short-range interceptor Shinden?

816
01:23:52,714 --> 01:23:55,592
Can you make this fly?

817
01:23:58,678 --> 01:24:01,430
We'll do all we can.

818
01:24:01,431 --> 01:24:02,932
Thank you.

819
01:24:03,975 --> 01:24:06,478
Good luck. Good luck.

820
01:24:24,829 --> 01:24:26,122
What's wrong?

821
01:24:26,748 --> 01:24:30,084
Brighten up, Mastermind.
It's bad for morale.

822
01:24:30,085 --> 01:24:32,002
I know it's my plan.

823
01:24:32,003 --> 01:24:36,381
But I'm feeling we'll need
a miracle to make it work.

824
01:24:36,382 --> 01:24:41,220
Doing nothing won't
cause a miracle either.

825
01:24:41,221 --> 01:24:42,555
You're right.

826
01:24:43,264 --> 01:24:46,392
Take a look at
these guys' faces.

827
01:24:47,727 --> 01:24:49,520
They're not stupid.

828
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:52,649
They know they're
risking their lives.

829
01:24:53,691 --> 01:24:54,776
And yet...

830
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:59,279
their faces are beaming.

831
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:04,285
They're happy. This time,
they'll make a difference.

832
01:25:05,245 --> 01:25:07,789
Make a difference.

833
01:25:09,332 --> 01:25:11,876
We all came through war.

834
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:16,214
This time, we're
making it right.

835
01:25:28,017 --> 01:25:31,311
2F CONFERENCE ROOM 3, SPECIAL
DISASTER COUNTERMEASURE HQ

836
01:25:31,312 --> 01:25:32,312
Hurry up!

837
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:36,985
Make room.

838
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:41,864
One hour ago, east
of Hachijo Island,

839
01:25:41,865 --> 01:25:46,160
33.10 North, 140.01 East,

840
01:25:46,161 --> 01:25:50,289
we got Geiger readings
from multiple buoys

841
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:51,415
followed by...

842
01:25:51,416 --> 01:25:53,418
here and here.

843
01:26:09,309 --> 01:26:10,977
Godzilla's coming.

844
01:26:11,811 --> 01:26:13,312
{\an8}At last.

845
01:26:13,313 --> 01:26:18,650
{\an8}At this rate, it's due to
arrive over the Sagami Trench

846
01:26:18,651 --> 01:26:21,445
{\an8}at 1100 hours
tomorrow, which means

847
01:26:21,446 --> 01:26:25,658
{\an8}we have to mobilize and
be in positions by 0800.

848
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:28,578
But tell me...

849
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:31,539
will your device
be ready by then?

850
01:26:32,957 --> 01:26:34,875
Take us with you.

851
01:26:34,876 --> 01:26:37,502
The final three hours
will be critical.

852
01:26:37,503 --> 01:26:39,296
We want it to be perfect.

853
01:26:39,297 --> 01:26:42,967
But you could get
caught in the fight.

854
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:46,221
We've all seen war too.

855
01:26:51,976 --> 01:26:57,976
Then everybody, go home tonight.
Spend the time with your families.

856
01:27:00,526 --> 01:27:01,945
You mean... be prepared?

857
01:27:07,116 --> 01:27:08,534
Come to think of it...

858
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:14,207
this country has treated
life far too cheaply.

859
01:27:15,124 --> 01:27:17,377
Poorly armored tanks,

860
01:27:18,086 --> 01:27:24,086
poor supply chains resulting in half of
all deaths from starvation and disease,

861
01:27:25,677 --> 01:27:30,848
fighter planes built
without ejection seats,

862
01:27:31,849 --> 01:27:36,437
and finally, kamikaze
and suicide attacks.

863
01:27:38,398 --> 01:27:40,733
That's why this time...

864
01:27:42,151 --> 01:27:44,779
I'd take pride in a
citizen-led effort...

865
01:27:46,531 --> 01:27:49,784
that sacrifices no lives at all!

866
01:27:51,452 --> 01:27:53,538
This next battle...

867
01:27:54,289 --> 01:27:56,374
is not one waged to the death...

868
01:27:57,667 --> 01:28:00,420
but a battle to
live for the future.

869
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:09,554
Let's do it!

870
01:28:12,849 --> 01:28:15,475
Finally, tomorrow's the day.

871
01:28:15,476 --> 01:28:16,601
I can't wait.

872
01:28:16,602 --> 01:28:18,354
You're not going.

873
01:28:20,732 --> 01:28:21,649
What do you mean?

874
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:25,236
Well, you're useless
with that arm, anyway.

875
01:28:25,737 --> 01:28:27,655
Even Shikishima's going!

876
01:28:28,197 --> 01:28:30,490
Because I'm not a veteran?

877
01:28:30,491 --> 01:28:32,200
I can be useful.

878
01:28:32,201 --> 01:28:35,455
Not having been to war...

879
01:28:36,205 --> 01:28:38,416
is something to be proud of.

880
01:28:44,881 --> 01:28:47,175
I want to defend my country too.

881
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:52,638
Take me with you!

882
01:28:54,974 --> 01:28:57,935
We've been a team
for a long time!

883
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,938
I'm begging you!

884
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:03,566
Take me with you!

885
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,109
I want to go with you!

886
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:08,820
We leave you the future.

887
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:10,572
Captain!

888
01:29:10,573 --> 01:29:12,116
Mr. Noda!

889
01:29:23,419 --> 01:29:25,129
A little lower.

890
01:29:25,671 --> 01:29:26,881
Careful.

891
01:29:42,647 --> 01:29:45,608
Here you go, Akiko.

892
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,200
I want to...

893
01:29:55,785 --> 01:29:59,038
thank you for everything.

894
01:30:12,343 --> 01:30:13,719
Akiko.

895
01:30:14,637 --> 01:30:16,263
Did you have fun with Auntie?

896
01:30:16,264 --> 01:30:17,722
It was fun.

897
01:30:17,723 --> 01:30:20,393
Good. I'm glad.

898
01:30:24,689 --> 01:30:25,982
Is that for me?

899
01:30:27,859 --> 01:30:29,026
Thank you.

900
01:30:34,699 --> 01:30:36,825
- Akiko?
- Hmm?

901
01:30:36,826 --> 01:30:41,330
Is this you, me and Mom?

902
01:30:42,457 --> 01:30:44,667
That's Mom there.

903
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,253
I see.

904
01:30:48,463 --> 01:30:50,006
It's really good.

905
01:31:00,808 --> 01:31:02,768
Why do you look sad?

906
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:09,441
What's wrong?

907
01:31:09,442 --> 01:31:10,776
Akiko.

908
01:31:11,569 --> 01:31:13,905
There, there.

909
01:31:15,573 --> 01:31:20,661
It'll be all right.
I'm not leaving you.

910
01:32:37,029 --> 01:32:38,322
Mr. Tachibana.

911
01:32:40,324 --> 01:32:41,367
Is it ready?

912
01:32:45,204 --> 01:32:46,539
Give me a minute.

913
01:32:58,426 --> 01:33:00,011
The bomb you ordered.

914
01:33:01,387 --> 01:33:06,099
Two machine guns, 140kg...
120 rounds, 80kg...

915
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,769
and one main fuel
tank, 400kg, removed.

916
01:33:09,395 --> 01:33:13,983
Instead, a No. 25 bomb in the
nose and a No. 50 in the fuselage.

917
01:33:15,651 --> 01:33:18,571
Now, I can finally
pay them back.

918
01:33:32,752 --> 01:33:34,170
That's funny.

919
01:33:38,591 --> 01:33:40,760
Part of me wants to live.

920
01:33:45,389 --> 01:33:47,850
Same as all the men that day.

921
01:33:49,101 --> 01:33:51,062
They all wanted to go home.

922
01:33:52,521 --> 01:33:58,069
But instead, they got
squashed like bugs.

923
01:33:59,695 --> 01:34:01,489
I understand.

924
01:34:24,553 --> 01:34:26,931
This was drawn by
a girl named Akiko.

925
01:34:28,933 --> 01:34:31,060
I want to protect her future.

926
01:34:35,398 --> 01:34:38,943
I will stop Godzilla
no matter what.

927
01:34:39,902 --> 01:34:42,238
You're finally ready.

928
01:34:44,365 --> 01:34:48,244
Then, this is important.

929
01:34:48,911 --> 01:34:50,121
Look here.

930
01:34:51,247 --> 01:34:53,332
The bombs' safety.

931
01:34:53,958 --> 01:34:55,750
Pull it right before flying in.

932
01:34:55,751 --> 01:34:57,253
Got it?

933
01:34:58,921 --> 01:35:00,172
One more thing.

934
01:35:10,433 --> 01:35:11,684
Akiko.

935
01:35:13,853 --> 01:35:16,647
Are you all by yourself?

936
01:35:17,565 --> 01:35:18,691
Look.

937
01:35:25,656 --> 01:35:27,283
{\an8}TO SUMIKO...

938
01:35:39,795 --> 01:35:44,258
LOOK AFTER AKIKO. USE
THIS MONEY FOR HER.

939
01:35:51,724 --> 01:35:54,351
From Daddy?

940
01:35:55,019 --> 01:35:58,689
Huh? Yeah, from Daddy.

941
01:35:59,565 --> 01:36:01,984
It's all right. Don't worry.

942
01:36:19,168 --> 01:36:23,755
This is Kuroshio 12,
35.03 North, 139.41 East.

943
01:36:23,756 --> 01:36:25,508
Many deep-sea fish found!

944
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:49,989
<i>Godzilla sighted in Sagami Bay!</i>

945
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:53,326
<i>Underwater guidance
decoy activated!</i>

946
01:36:53,327 --> 01:36:56,247
Take only essentials with you!

947
01:36:57,122 --> 01:36:58,414
Hurry and get aboard!

948
01:36:58,415 --> 01:37:00,459
Let's get a move on.

949
01:37:02,086 --> 01:37:03,878
Mizushima took our advice?

950
01:37:03,879 --> 01:37:05,713
It's the best thing for him.

951
01:37:05,714 --> 01:37:08,633
I didn't want Shikishima
to fly either.

952
01:37:08,634 --> 01:37:12,095
A failed kamikaze
pilot? It worries me.

953
01:37:12,096 --> 01:37:15,391
He's got Akiko. He'll
make it back alive.

954
01:37:25,568 --> 01:37:28,236
<i>Underwater decoy team destroyed!</i>

955
01:37:28,237 --> 01:37:33,826
<i>Godzilla has entered Sagami Bay!
Wada Tsumi ships, leave port now!</i>

956
01:37:34,326 --> 01:37:35,411
Look.

957
01:37:36,328 --> 01:37:37,537
There!

958
01:37:37,538 --> 01:37:39,582
It's already here?

959
01:37:50,634 --> 01:37:54,555
<i>Godzilla's through the final
defense line! Heading for shore!</i>

960
01:37:55,639 --> 01:37:56,765
I'm off!

961
01:38:50,986 --> 01:38:55,783
{\an8}Time to end it once and
for all, Shikishima.

962
01:38:56,325 --> 01:39:02,325
<i>Leave port now! Repeat. Wada
Tsumi ships, leave port now!</i>

963
01:39:09,672 --> 01:39:12,383
What now? The plan's ruined!

964
01:39:13,008 --> 01:39:15,009
We set sail anyway.

965
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:20,139
We need to sink it over Sagami
Trench, or it won't work.

966
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:23,559
Shikishima will have to lure it!

967
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,727
Move out!

968
01:39:24,728 --> 01:39:25,728
Let's go!

969
01:39:41,996 --> 01:39:44,456
Radio from Mr. Shikishima!

970
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:50,545
I'm in the air, preparing to
lure Godzilla to the target area.

971
01:39:50,546 --> 01:39:52,714
We'll be ready.

972
01:39:52,715 --> 01:39:54,173
<i>Get there quickly.</i>

973
01:39:54,174 --> 01:39:59,263
Don't do anything rash! I won't
forgive you if you orphan Akiko.

974
01:40:02,349 --> 01:40:04,476
You hear me, Shikishima?

975
01:40:05,978 --> 01:40:08,397
He's ignoring me.

976
01:40:31,211 --> 01:40:32,796
Telegram!

977
01:40:34,048 --> 01:40:35,090
Coming.

978
01:40:41,764 --> 01:40:42,764
Yes?

979
01:40:42,765 --> 01:40:44,349
Mrs. Shikishima?

980
01:40:46,685 --> 01:40:48,353
- Telegram.
- Thanks.

981
01:42:11,812 --> 01:42:15,315
Wow, he's luring it out to sea!

982
01:42:15,983 --> 01:42:19,443
Godzilla looks
really ticked off.

983
01:42:19,444 --> 01:42:21,070
It's in pursuit.

984
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:22,906
Our turn now.

985
01:42:25,909 --> 01:42:29,913
All ships, battle positions!

986
01:42:32,541 --> 01:42:33,541
Freon, ready!

987
01:42:34,042 --> 01:42:36,586
46-cm shells, ready!
Flotation switch, ready!

988
01:42:36,587 --> 01:42:38,212
Cables, ready!

989
01:42:38,213 --> 01:42:40,590
All circuits, ready!

990
01:42:40,591 --> 01:42:43,594
Power on, release safety device!

991
01:42:59,943 --> 01:43:02,696
That's it. Keep coming.

992
01:43:04,114 --> 01:43:07,784
- Team 1, attack as planned.
- As planned!

993
01:43:38,857 --> 01:43:41,235
Attaboy.

994
01:44:17,604 --> 01:44:20,816
That's Godzilla's heat ray.

995
01:44:23,068 --> 01:44:28,364
The ships won't survive this.
All ships must evacuate!

996
01:44:28,365 --> 01:44:29,740
No, this is okay.

997
01:44:29,741 --> 01:44:31,325
Stick to the plan.

998
01:44:31,326 --> 01:44:33,244
But the heat ray!

999
01:44:33,245 --> 01:44:38,040
Once fired, it takes
time to regenerate.

1000
01:44:38,041 --> 01:44:39,501
We go, now!

1001
01:44:40,502 --> 01:44:41,712
Give the order!

1002
01:44:47,217 --> 01:44:49,303
Commence Operation Wada Tsumi!

1003
01:45:07,738 --> 01:45:11,908
Deploy 46-cm shells, freon
cylinders, and flotation device!

1004
01:45:37,392 --> 01:45:38,894
Shikishima!

1005
01:46:04,795 --> 01:46:06,045
Crane deployed!

1006
01:46:06,046 --> 01:46:07,047
Roger!

1007
01:46:07,964 --> 01:46:10,299
Maintain course, Hibiki!

1008
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,718
Hibiki, maintain course!

1009
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:16,098
Maintain speed. Some
damage inevitable.

1010
01:46:20,435 --> 01:46:23,188
Hibiki closing in, 4 meters!

1011
01:46:24,064 --> 01:46:25,564
2 meters!

1012
01:46:25,565 --> 01:46:28,777
- Brace for impact!
- Brace for impact!

1013
01:46:43,667 --> 01:46:48,213
- Crossing complete! Full speed!
- Full speed!

1014
01:47:02,978 --> 01:47:05,689
Yes! Yes!

1015
01:47:06,356 --> 01:47:08,650
- Captain, the switch!
- Roger!

1016
01:47:16,658 --> 01:47:19,035
Oh, no. Not yet?

1017
01:47:20,328 --> 01:47:21,371
Almost.

1018
01:47:31,465 --> 01:47:34,384
Ready...

1019
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,479
Hit it, Captain!

1020
01:47:47,689 --> 01:47:49,316
- Freon!
- Got it!

1021
01:48:05,957 --> 01:48:10,545
Depth 1,200 meters!
1,300 meters!

1022
01:48:11,254 --> 01:48:13,214
- 1,400 meters!
- Keep going!

1023
01:48:13,215 --> 01:48:14,966
- Dive!
- 1,450 meters!

1024
01:48:16,343 --> 01:48:20,138
{\an8}1,500! Target-depth exceeded!

1025
01:48:32,234 --> 01:48:35,069
{\an8}We sunk Godzilla!

1026
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:36,530
Did it succeed?

1027
01:48:44,287 --> 01:48:46,039
Persistent bastard.

1028
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:49,167
- Move to Plan B.
- Do it.

1029
01:49:07,644 --> 01:49:09,311
Now rise!

1030
01:49:09,312 --> 01:49:14,359
Depth 1,200 meters! 1,100
meters, 1,000 meters!

1031
01:49:23,076 --> 01:49:24,244
Cables stopped!

1032
01:49:25,078 --> 01:49:27,289
They stopped at 803 meters!

1033
01:49:28,039 --> 01:49:30,375
Why? Why did they stop?

1034
01:49:35,088 --> 01:49:36,506
It chewed through them.

1035
01:49:39,676 --> 01:49:42,136
Hibiki, we'll pull Godzilla up!

1036
01:49:42,137 --> 01:49:43,929
90 degrees, max speed!

1037
01:49:43,930 --> 01:49:46,473
The two ships lack the thrust.

1038
01:49:46,474 --> 01:49:50,061
We've no choice.
Give it all you can!

1039
01:49:50,645 --> 01:49:51,855
Yes, sir!

1040
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:10,331
At this rate,

1041
01:50:10,332 --> 01:50:11,790
the crane won't hold.

1042
01:50:11,791 --> 01:50:13,293
Clear out!

1043
01:50:35,565 --> 01:50:40,235
<i>This is Yokohama
Eisen's Fujimaru!</i>

1044
01:50:40,236 --> 01:50:42,821
<i>Doing our best to help!</i>

1045
01:50:42,822 --> 01:50:44,115
That voice.

1046
01:50:44,783 --> 01:50:47,577
Mizushima here. Is
that you, Captain?

1047
01:50:48,745 --> 01:50:50,872
Kid, is that you?

1048
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:52,666
You bet!

1049
01:50:52,667 --> 01:50:56,543
<i>This is Toyo Kisen's
Koeimaru, here to help!</i>

1050
01:50:56,544 --> 01:51:00,214
<i>And Yokohama Eisen's
Nikkomaru! At your service!</i>

1051
01:51:00,215 --> 01:51:02,007
<i>Shiokazemaru, assisting!</i>

1052
01:51:02,008 --> 01:51:03,384
<i>Tetsuyumaru.</i>

1053
01:51:03,385 --> 01:51:05,094
<i>- Nanamimaru.
- Minamimaru.</i>

1054
01:51:05,095 --> 01:51:06,762
<i>- Kisshomaru.
- Junseimaru.</i>

1055
01:51:06,763 --> 01:51:08,097
<i>- Wakamaru.
- Heimitsumaru.</i>

1056
01:51:08,098 --> 01:51:09,515
<i>Tenyumaru</i>.

1057
01:51:09,516 --> 01:51:11,058
<i>- Kaiomaru.
- Hyuga.</i>

1058
01:51:11,059 --> 01:51:12,559
<i>- Choukamaru.
- Shoseimaru.</i>

1059
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,811
<i>- Taramaru.
- Yasakamaru.</i>

1060
01:51:13,812 --> 01:51:17,273
The useless to the rescue!

1061
01:51:20,151 --> 01:51:22,069
I'll be damned.

1062
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:25,072
I gotta admit I'm
glad to see him.

1063
01:51:25,073 --> 01:51:28,826
All you tugboats out there!
Let's catch a Godzilla!

1064
01:51:28,827 --> 01:51:32,956
- Everybody, pull!
- Everybody, pull!

1065
01:51:57,313 --> 01:52:00,275
Godzilla's rising again!

1066
01:52:01,818 --> 01:52:05,237
Come on, show your face!

1067
01:52:05,238 --> 01:52:07,866
Depth 700 meters!

1068
01:52:08,450 --> 01:52:10,535
Keep coming, keep coming!

1069
01:52:41,524 --> 01:52:42,984
It's not damaged enough!

1070
01:52:43,985 --> 01:52:46,112
All ships, evasive action!

1071
01:53:36,955 --> 01:53:38,539
What's he doing?

1072
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:39,749
No.

1073
01:53:43,586 --> 01:53:45,838
- Don't!
