00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,873
she is her culture.

186
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,793
She's the last living member
of the Iwi tribe.

187
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,294
We're just trying
to reach her.

188
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,549
I know. Join the club.

00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,218

194
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,140
Come on.

[crickets chirping]

00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,440
[narrator on TV]
For centuries,

197
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,900
the Iwi tribe were
the guardians of Skull Island,

198
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,361
the ancestral home
of the great Kong.

199
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,405
But when
shifting storm patterns

200
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,907
destroyed the island,
the Iwi were annihilated...

201
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,242
-[sighs]
-...with only a single member

202
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,703
of the tribe having survived.

203
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,455
-A young girl...
-[Kong roars]

204
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,207
...found and rescued
amid the punishing storm.

205
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,501
Her fellow villagers
were lost to the tides.

206
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,796
Gone to history, just like
the great Kongs themselves.

207
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,339
Holy shit.

208
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,091
-The Iwi were unique...
-[breathing heavily]

209
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,385
...in the sense that they
had no spoken language.

210
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,262
Many believe
that tribe members developed

211
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,722
the ability to communicate...

212
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,973

We're gonna figure this out.

[slow dramatic music playing]

225
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,460
[man] Where will you be

226
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,546
when the next Titan attacks?

227
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,341
How will you protect
the things and people

228
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,968
that matter most to you?

229
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,346
Today's podcast
is brought to you

230
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,181
by Gargantua insurance,
the only insurance company

231
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,100
that provides Titan protection
for your home

232
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,893
and personal belongings.

00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,812
'Cause Godzilla may not care
about your hopes and dreams,

-Okay, Titan truthers!

-Oh, we have got a lot...
-[sighs]

237
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,778
...to unpack on today's show.

238
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,363
[loudly] Recording in progress,

239
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,447
go away!

240
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,701
Uh, yes. I just want
to let everyone know

241
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,119
that there is no...

242
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,871
-[knocking on door]
-I'm gonna kill...

243
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,789
Unbelievable! What?

244
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,541
Uh...

245
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,545
Hi, Bernie.

246
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,547
Ilene Andrews,
we met in Hong Kong.

247
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,257
Oh. Oh.

248
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,675
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

249
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,594
Hong Kong.
Yeah, that was so long ago.

250
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,388
So, no, God, uh, yeah.

251
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,514
That was when
my hair was longer.

252
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,682
You cut your hair. [chuckles]

253
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,309
Highlights too, it's nice.

254
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,730
I was wondering if I could get
your help with something.

255
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,357
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

256
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,319
Uh, sure.

257
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,280
Sure, yeah. Of course, yeah.
Come on in, Doctor Andrews.

258
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,157
-Okay.
-Yeah.

259
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,366
Just straight down
that hall there.

260
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,743
To the left. Okay.

261
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,080
Have a seat.
What can I help you with?

262
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,083
You know, mi casa es su home.

263
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,294
[Ilene] Okay, so.
The sequence on the right,

264
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,546
this is a signal
that's been interfering

265
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,714
with our equipment
in Hollow Earth.

266
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,549
-Okay.
-And, uh...

267
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,178
And these are drawings
by my daughter, Jia.

268
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,848
And you're gonna think
that I'm completely insane.

269
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,893
No, the patterns are the same
in the middle section.

270
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,771
Yes. Exactly.

271
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,481
[sighs] Thank you.

272
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,107
Look, our analysts,

273
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,484
they don't know
what to make of this.

274
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,860
They're talking in circles,

275
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,320
they're saying
"radio interference,"

276
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,821
"coincidence," but I...

277
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,865
I know that you think
outside of the box.

278
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,201
[chuckles] I didn't know
who else to turn to.

279
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,702
And they sent you
here because...?

280
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,912
No, no one sent me.
I came here on my...

281
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,121
You know,
that's what's ironic.

282
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,706
You know,
Monarch wouldn't confirm

283
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,875
my crucial part
in taking down Mechagodzilla,

284
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,919
which cost me thousands of...

285
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,046
hundreds of subscribers
on my blog.

286
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,048
Oh, and the trolls...
[chuckles]

287
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,341
the trolls online,
they question

288
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,884
every single thing
that I put up.

289
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,886
Especially this one troll.

290
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,721
This one troll named
ghidorastan64.

291
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,056
You ever heard of him?

292
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,265
-No, I don't think I have.
-Great,

293
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,725
because he's a trash bag,
okay?

294
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,185
I'm more qualified
than half of those people

295
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,603
that you have working
over there.

296
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,230
I knew what Godzilla
was going to do

297
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,731
before anybody
at Monarch said...

298
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,442
Which is why I am here,
Bernie. [chuckles]

299
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,444
I am here. Okay?

300
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,782
Can you help me or not?

301
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,784
That depends.

302
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,828
Are you the new boss
down at the Mess?

303
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,162
The what?

304
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,539
The Monarch
Hollow Earth Station.

305
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,416
The MHES, the Mess.

306
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,959
Yeah, nobody calls it that.

307
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,752
I run the Kong
research division

308
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,463
but technically
Director Hampton is in charge

309
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,465
-of general operations.
-Hmm.

310
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,092
Well, Director Hampton
doesn't have a kid

311
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,552
who can talk to Kong.

312
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,266
You want to go
to Hollow Earth.

313
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,892
[gasps excitedly] I'm so glad
I didn't have to say it.

314
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,519
I thought you were never
gonna ask

315
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,062
-but I really do need proof.
-No, I'm not asking.

316
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,772
I mean, that would help me
with my bona fides

317
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,274
for my blog. And I knew
that you would be the person

318
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,942
-to help me do that.
-[cell phone buzzing]

319
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,110
Okay. Well, if this happens,
and that is a big if,

320
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,862
then Monarch would need,
you know,

321
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,405
whatever you guys call it.
Final cut on anything in...

322
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,449
[Bernie] Whoa. I'm sorry,
final cut? No, no, no.

323
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,576
You know, that will destroy
my journalistic integrity.

324
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,244
Shit.

325
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,662
No really true, good
documentarian gives final cut.

326
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,122
I could make you a producer.

327
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,665
Okay, okay! Fine! Final cut!
Final cut! Fine!

328
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,125
Look, something is happening
to my daughter,

329
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,045
and I have no idea
how to fix it.

330
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,671
You work out what's going on,

331
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,881
and I will get you anything
that you want, okay?

332
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,215
That is a promise.

333
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,467
Well, anything is a lot,

334
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,968
but that's very generous,
but I...

335
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,804
-And we have to go. Right now.
-What?

336
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,681
Godzilla is on the move again.

337

[suspenseful music playing]

343
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,656
[Ilene] Okay, listen to me.

344
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,241
If Godzilla's on the move,
he senses a threat coming.

345
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,784
We don't know what it is.

346
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,035
[man on phone]
And you're not concerned?

347
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,537
Of course we're concerned,
Senator.

348
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,413
That's why we're monitoring
the situation.

349
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,373
[Senator] Monitor the fact
that if Godzilla heads...

350
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,874
What is it? You just...

351
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,542
-And I am telling you,
-We have a problem!

352
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,876
Senator...

353
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,545
that Kong doesn't
leave Hollow Earth.

354
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,549
Which is why Godzilla has
no reason to retaliate.

355
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,967
[alarm blaring]

356
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,804

00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,932
[grunts]

358
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,976
[indistinct chatter]

359
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,979
-What's he doing up here?
-No idea.

360
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,314
-Well, does Godzilla know?

00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,952
So, is there, like,
a in-flight briefing

545

that I should know about?
You know...

-Yeah, there is.
-He's very...

it's outside my vehicle.

[Ilene sighs]

733
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,669
Are you getting
anything off that thing?

734
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,795
Yeah, I'm just...

735
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,841
Oh, my God.

736
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:04,925
What?

737
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,304
Here. Take a look.

738
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,223
It looks like an ape.
But that's impossible.

739
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,517
What the bloody hell is that?

740
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,977
I have no idea.

741
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,729
[signal glitching]

742
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,065

-[Ilene] Whoa.

743
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,983
[Trapper] Mikael! Mikael!

744
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,276
I'm working on it!

745
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,569
Come on, you...

746
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,779
[Bernie] God!
Okay, okay, okay!

[engine thrusters roaring]

748
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,076
The hell was that, Mikael?

749
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,702
Calm down. Calm down.

750
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,079
It must've been the signal.
The same electrical

751
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,538
disturbances were
happening at the outpost.

752
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,706
[in sign language]

753
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,875
[Bernie] Oh, come on. Come on.

754
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,505
[sighs heavily]

755
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,131
She says it's coming
from that ridge point.

756
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,389
Well, let's take a look.

757
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,890
[Mikael]
I'll get as close as I can.

758
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,728
[door whirring and hissing]

[gasps in disbelief]

762
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,825
The Hollow Earth.

763
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,284
[gasps]

764
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,830
A world untouched by mankind.

765
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,416
Is this
how Neil Armstrong felt

766
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,876
when he stepped on alien soil?

767
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,381
[over video]
Is this one small step for me,

768
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,590
and one giant leap for...

769
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,883
Who are you talking to?

770
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,343
Are you kidding me?

771
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,262
Right down the lens?
It's a documentary.

772
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,013
You wanna be natural.
Just walk, if you just walk.

773
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,099
-All right, just keep...
-Yeah, just... Okay. Take two.

774
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,934
[Bernie clears throat]

775
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:41,522
The Hollow Earth. A world...

776
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,732
[Mikael] All right, guys.
That ridge you pointed out

777
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,651
is about two miles
straight ahead.

778
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,072
[mosquitos buzzing]

779
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,657
I'm getting eaten alive
out here.

780
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,409
[mosquito buzzing]

781
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:57,037
Oh, look at that.
I must be tasty too.

782
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,831
Kill it.

783
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,877
Only female mosquitos
drink blood.

784
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,462
So they can grow their eggs.

785
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,672
[mosquito buzzing]

786
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,257
She needs it more than me.

787
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,677
[captivating music playing]

788
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,774
[Trapper] Wait.

789
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,486
-[Ilene] What?
-What's the holdup?

790
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,070
Not this way.

791
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,822
What? Why?

792
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,407
Yeah, we gotta take a detour.
There's something here.

793
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,659
Where, here? Like here, here?

794
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,870
[Ilene] Hey.

795
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,747
Nah. I'm not picking
anything up.

796
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,123
No. Something
doesn't smell right,

797
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,750
and it's not just you, Mikael.

798
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,878
Can you smell that?
It's like rotting flesh.

799
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,005
It's probably
just a carcass upwind.

800
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,340
-We keep moving.
-Mikael, hold up.

801
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,175
Listen, pal. I'm gonna trust

802
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,177
my state of the art thermal
over your

00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,763
Ace Ventura
hippie-dippie sixth sense

804
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,973
all day long. You got me?

805
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,308
There's no need to call
people names. We're just...

806
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,976
Hey. And as for you,
freak show,

807
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,020
if you don't shut it,
I'm gonna take that camera,

808
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,355
I'm gonna shove it
right up your arse.

809
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,814
I'm in charge, we move.

810
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,233
Why don't we just listen
to somebody calmer?

811
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,567
I said I'm in charge.

812
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,110
I'm in charge! [yells]

813
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,612
-[Bernie] Whoa!
-[all gasp]

814
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,239

-[Bernie whimpering]
-[tree belches]

817
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,745
[Bernie] It was a tree.
It was a tree!

818
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,372
[Trapper] Wait, wait, wait.

819
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,706
We should be all right.
We should be all right.

820
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,083
Those things
don't reach that far.

821
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,668
He was just eaten by a tree.

822
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,253
-[Trapper] What you doing, Doc?
-[radio beeps]

823
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,921
[Ilene] I'm trying to call
the Base for extraction.

824
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,256
[Bernie] It's just, one minute
he was there, right?

825
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,507
He was right in my face.
And then, a tree!

826
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,424
-Outta nowhere!
-I know, man.

827
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,759
I know. That's heavy.

828
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,635
But that's
the natural world, man.

829
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,844
"Red in tooth and claw."

830
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,597
Tennyson.
You just watched a man

831
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,140
get devoured
by a topiary nightmare,

832
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,476
and you want to quote
Tennyson? Down here?

833
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,479
Yeah. Yeah, man.
He knew all about it.

834
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,606
"Let love clasp grief," man.
Come here.

835
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,983
[Bernie] Mm.

836
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,109
You know, humans,
we think we took

837
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,444
ourselves off the food chain,

838
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:57,032
but maybe, maybe the Titans
are here to remind us.

839
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,535
I think that
there is something

840
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,036
seriously wrong with you.

841
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,247
-Okay.
-Mm-kay.

842
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,124
-Okay.
-Mm.

843
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,167
-[radio beeps]
-[sighs] It's not working.

844
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,962
We better move on.
We'll mourn later.

845
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,007
Jia. Come on.

846
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,425
-Come on, bud.
-But the...

847
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,635
He was eaten by a tree.

848
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,596
I don't...
I don't want to die like that.

849
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,805
Not by a tree.

850
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,103
[crowd screaming]

851
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,479
[Godzilla growling]

852
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,816
[pilot over radio] Tower,

853
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,234
we can't get
any closer than this.

854
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,654
Godzilla's burning hot
with radiation.

855
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,282
Whatever he's headed for
has him really pissed off.

856
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,202
[roaring]

857
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,461
[Hampton over radio]
This is Base

858
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,004
calling Fifteen Alpha, over.

859
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,758
Fifteen Alpha responding.

860
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,509
Godzilla's current trajectory
is showing

861
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,345
[over radio] him heading
towards the Arctic Ocean.

862
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,096
[Hampton]
What Titans are in the area?

863
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,017
[alerts beeping]

864
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,353
[commander] Looks like
he's hunting Tiamat.

865
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,396
[automated voice]
Classified file three two four.

866
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,065
Titanus Tiamat.

867
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,566
Titan nineteen.

868
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,444
Extremely aggressive,
territorial.

869
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,447
Weaponizing her body
of razor-sharp scales...

870
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,158
Tiamat's Arctic lair
sits in the direct path

871
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,869
of electromagnetically charged
solar winds,

872
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,581
making it the largest
stockpile of energy on Earth.

873
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,001
If Godzilla takes down Tiamat,
he'll supercharge.

874
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,214
[gasps]

875
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,844
[Ilene] It's ruins.

876
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,389
Human civilization?

877
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,307
Down here?

878
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,187
[Ilene] Hey.

879
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,900
[in sign language]

880
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,111
Yeah.

881
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,862
The markings are older
than the ones

882
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,614
on Skull Island.
Centuries older.

883
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,493
[Ilene gasps]

884
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,121
But the architecture is
consistent with the Iwi.

00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,390
Whoa.

888
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,113
Oh, this is remarkable.

889
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,698
[camera clicks]

890
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,291
Now, that's weird.

891
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,294
There's no moss on these ones.

892
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,218
Hello.

893
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,768
[Ilene] Mothra.

[Bernie and Trapper]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

907
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:11,870
[Bernie] It's like some kind of
a irrigation system. [laughs]

908
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,705
Only this predates everything

That's incredible.

It's the Iwi calling for help.

1076
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:48,293
-[Trapper] Oh. Whoa.
-[Ilene gasps]

1077
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,929
So, wait. They send out
this SOS, and then what?

1078
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,347
Godzilla hears it?

1079
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,725
Yeah. They woke him up.

1080
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,351
An SOS for what?
They already live

1081
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,644
in a nightmare
monster hellscape.

1082
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,187
What could possibly
scare them?

1083
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,023
Hey. She can understand
everything that you say.

1084
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,650
-She understands me?
-Oh, good.

1085
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,277
And a nightmare
monster hellscape

1086
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,322
is a wonderful place
to raise a family.

1087
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,492
[Bernie shudders]

1088

1096
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,215
[Trapper] Oh, wow.

1097
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,884
[Ilene] This whole room
is covered in Iwi script.

1098
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,642
It says that in the beginning,

1099
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:31,604
Hollow Earth lived in harmony
with the surface world.

1100
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,941
The Titans were
the guardians of nature

1101
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:38,611
and the Great Apes became
the protectors of humanity.

1102
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,951
But a great evil
threatened the peace.

1103
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,162
A powerful and ruthless ape

1104
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,581
desperate to conquer
the surface world,

1105
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:54,585
led his tribe into war
against the one they call...

1106
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,629
The Monster Who Ate a Star.

1107
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,297
Godzilla.

1108
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,717
[Ilene] There's more.

1109
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,428
The war with the Apes
nearly destroyed Godzilla.

1110
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,138
But after a great battle,

1111
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,639
he imprisoned the apes

1112
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,850
in a fiery realm
of Hollow Earth.

1113
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:11,352
Their false king
remains obsessed

1114
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,104
with reaching the surface.

1115
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:16,357

the Skar King.

the Skar King harnessed
a terrible power.

1198
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,705

[Ilene] He controls her

Her power covered the Earth
in the last ice age.

1202
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:23,636
We brought Kong down here.

1203
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,429
He's been looking
for others like himself,

1204
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:27,139
going deeper
into Hollow Earth

1205
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,266
and getting closer
to their prison.

1206
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,602
The Iwi must have known
it was just a matter of time,

1207
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:33,312
and that's why they've been

1208
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,690
calling for help, and that's
why Godzilla's changing.

1209
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,234
He's gearing up
for World War Three.

1210
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,277
Okay, but he barely survived
last time.

1211
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,946
What's Godzilla
gonna do on his own?

1212

He won't be on his own.

1213

The Iwi believe
that at the end of the world,

1214
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:52,414
one of their own
will return...

1215
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:55,751
and awaken Mothra,
defender of the Iwi...

1216
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,504
and ancient ally of Godzilla.

1217
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,714
They believe
that their savior will be

1218
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,549
an Iwi from Skull Island.

1219
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,763

[Ilene] You know, I made
a deal with myself

1241
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,552
when I became a mother.

1242
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:55,013
I said to myself, "I don't care
what you have to sacrifice...

1243
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:58,225
what you have to give up,

1244

by that little girl."

I just never thought that

1247
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,818
the thing I'd be giving up
would be her.

1248
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,445
Look, you don't know that.

1249
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,612
Really?

Trapper, before we came here

1251
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:15,534
she said that
she didn't belong anywhere.

1252
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,537
If this is the life
that she wants,

1253
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,205
then I have to give her up.
