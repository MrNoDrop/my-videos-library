A FILM BY QUARXX

3
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,710
Holy shit, I made it.

4
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,254
I'm not hurt.

5
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,915
- Did you see the state of your car?
- Huh?

6
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,713
Did you see the state of your car?

7
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,637
I can't believe how lucky I was.

8
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,973
Did you take a look at my bike?

9
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,353
You were on that bike?

10
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,105
Yes, that was me.

11
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,733
I'm really sorry.

12
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,196
I didn't see you.

13
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,324
I tried to avoid you at the last second.

14
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,329
The car must have rolled over, I think.

15
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:44,915
Are you alright?

16
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,461
Considering the violence
of the impact, you were...

17
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,963
You were also really lucky.

18
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,386
Are you hurt somewhere?

19
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,971
I'm gonna call 911.

20
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,189
Shit, I must have left it in the car.

21
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,359
After the accident...

22
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,406
...do you remember
getting out of the car?

23
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,119
Uh, no, I...

24
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,166
No.

25
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,377
I must have had a shock.

26
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:36,216
I remember my head banging
against the dashboard.

27
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,764
Does your head hurt?
Do you have a wound?

28
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,355
No.

29
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,445
What's your name?

30
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,739
Nathan.

31
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,158
Daniel.

32
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,243
Nice to meet you, Nathan.

33
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,203
Nice to meet you, Daniel.

34
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,706
It's a surprising meeting,
don't you think?

35
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,000
Right.

36
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,462
We'll remember it for sure.

37
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,594
You are my first undead.

38
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,224
What?

39
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,936
We didn't make it.
Don't you understand?

40
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,650
- What are you talking about?
- You heard me.

41
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,780
I heard you, but it makes no sense.
You must be in shock.

42
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,616
No, but I'm no longer in denial.

43
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,411
I've been here longer than you.

44
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,498
I must have died on the spot.

45
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,625
It must have taken you a little longer.

46
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,128
It also took me a little while
to understand.

47
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,926
What are you saying?
What about all this?

48
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,095
What's all this?

49
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,600
You can say whatever you want,
but this moment is real.

50
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,898
This is my body.

51
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,274
My feelings.

52
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,616
The last thing I remember

53
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,578
is sliding into the crash barrier

54
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,081
and being sad at the idea
of not seeing my wife again.

55
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,792
I have good news.
You'll see her again.

56
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:39,297
Then I remember a huge, powerful,
black mass crashing into me.

57
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,008
It was you and your car, Nathan.

58
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,969
You're crazy.

59
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,181
It should be easy to get
to the bottom of it, right?

60
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,400
Yes, it should.

61
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,577
Well?

62
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,997
Wait, the driver's compartment
is completely staved in.

63
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,249
And that doesn't ring a bell?

64
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,375
Shut up!

65
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,169
What you're telling me
is not possible.

66
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,888
What did I tell you?

67
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,350
No, no. No.

68
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,687
No, no, no, no!

69
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,689
No, no, no!
No! No, no, no!

70
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,900
Calm down, Nathan.

71
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,693
What do you mean, calm down?

72
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:46,323
You didn't come face to face
with your own corpse!

73
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,784
I can't be looking my best
under your car either.

74
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,580
But I...

75
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,875
I feel alive.

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,043
I...

77
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,337
I feel...

78
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,509
I feel sad, I feel scared.
That's human feelings!

79
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,304
It might be just a phase.
What do I know?

80
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,599
It's the first time
it's happened to me.

81
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,434
But I don't want to die.

82
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,436
It's not possible.

83
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,900
My wife will be very sad.

84
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,401
It will kill her.

85
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,030
She warned me
not to buy this motorbike.

86
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,243
What about me?
My friends? My kids?

87
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,497
I'm only 45!

88
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,667
I had my life ahead of me.

89
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,961
We always think
we have our life ahead of us

90
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,671
until it ends.

91
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,549
Thank you
for the condescending lesson,

92
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,468
but it doesn't help.

93
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,055
No, no, I refuse.

94
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,642
Funny, you didn't mention your wife.

95
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,769
What?

96
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,313
Won't you miss your wife?

97
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,983
Why do you say that?

98
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,318
Because I will miss mine a lot.

99
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,447
Mind your own business, please.

100
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,412
Do you realize the implications?

101
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,588
Life after death exists!

102
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,219
Here we are, talking normally
as if nothing has happened.

103
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,025
To think I was a non-believer!

104
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,862
If only I'd known!

105
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,077
I feel good, despite the circumstances.

106
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,997
I feel a sense of fulfillment.

107
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,207
I don't give a shit
about your fulfillment!

108
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,754
I want my body back!
I want my life back!

109
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,383
I'm dreaming.

110
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,845
It's the effect of the anesthetic.
I must be in surgery by now.

111
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,186
I must be on the operating table.
I'm gonna wake up from this nightmare.

112
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,562
Really?

113
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,357
You don't exist!

114
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,071
What are you doing?

115
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,323
No, no, no. Don't!

116
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,741
No.

117
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,160
- I said don't!
- Quiet.

118
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,215
You need to face reality,

119
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,424
Nathan!

120
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,803
This doesn't feel right.

121
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,930
I don't like it at all.

122
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:03,561
Could you please turn my head around?

123
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,191
Wait.

124
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,745
Is that better?

125
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,834
A little better.

126
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,514
How did you manage to drag my body
out of the car if you're dead?

127
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,975
I don't know, I just did.

128
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,477
I don't know how this works yet.

129
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,944
A car is coming.

130
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,831
He might help us.

131
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,583
What are you talking about?

132
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,210
Please call 911.

133
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,503
I've had an accident.

134
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,964
I fell into the ditch.
Call for an ambulance.

135
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,592
Hurry up!

136
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,804
- He can't hear us. We're dead.
- Yeah, but...

137
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,098
Maybe I can be revived.

138
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,351
I'm gonna rejoin my body.
I'm getting the hell out of here!

139
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,477
Call an...

140
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,900
Call an ambulance, goddammit!

141
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,738
I don't believe it.
The bastard's picking my pockets!

142
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,573
Hey!

143
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,593
I can't believe this.

144
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,940
I'm a fucking ghost.

145
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,528
Am I really dead?

146
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,323
If there was any doubt before,
there is none now.

147
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,332
It's a catastrophe.

148
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,460
There's no way back.

149
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,129
It's a disaster.

150
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,218
A total disaster.

151
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,850
Is it true what they say
about life after death?

152
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,811
Heaven, hell, all that.

153
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,940
We should find out anytime now.

154
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,027
Are we gonna be judged
based on our actions?

155
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,990
You know that song,
<i>We're All Going to Heaven</i>?

156
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,158
Even if we've killed someone?

157
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,703
You've killed someone?

158
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,080
No, no.
Not really, but kind of, yes.

159
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,665
- Who?
- My wife.

160
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,001
- Your wife?
- Yes, but it's not what you think.

161
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,127
Shh!

162
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,587
What?

163
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,257
Do you hear that?

164
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,468
No. What?

165
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,222
The music.

166
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,348
What?

167
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,351
What music? I don't hear any music!
Why don't I hear it?

168
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,770
Listen!

169
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,108
I hear nothing except silence.

170
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,320
A deadly silence.

171
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,325
I don't like your sense of humor.

172
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,553
That must be for us.

173
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,557
The music, it's coming from there.

174
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,559
Why don't I hear it?

175
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,770
It's magnificent!

176
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,813
What's magnificent?

177
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,487
I've never heard music like it.

178
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,238
Fuck. Why don't I hear it?

179
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,870
It is the way into the next world.

180
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,915
Let's not waste any more time!

181
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,793
Not so fast!

182
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,423
Who is this one for?

183
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,175
How should I know?

184
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,480
Actually, I do hear your music now.

185
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,983
But, it's not really music.

186
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,777
It's more like screams.

187
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,863
No it's not,
it's harps and trumpets.

188
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,493
We don't hear the same thing at all.

189
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,120
We each have our own door.

190
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,499
There's no way
I'm going through that door.

191
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,084
Have you seen it?

192
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,336
Would you go through it?

193
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,630
I would hesitate, it's true.

194
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,173
There you go, then.

195
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:32,432
But if you hear things
coming from that door that I don't hear,

196
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:37,228
and I hear music that you don't hear
coming from the other one,

197
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,563
I think the message is clear!

198
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,523
That's easy for you to say!

199
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,567
I didn't kill my wife!

200
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,113
What exactly do you mean?

201
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,783
Hey! I have the right to explain myself.

202
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,494
I have the right to defend myself!
She was sick!

203
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,080
You know that very well!

204
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,249
I only put her out of her misery!

205
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,042
Murder is murder, Nathan.

206
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,588
You're starting to piss me off!
You have your place in heaven!

207
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,006
Give me a break!

208
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,925
I'm leaving you.
I'm going back to my door.

209
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,858
They must have anticipated
this possibility.

210
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,776
I had to try.

211
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,030
You don't behave
like a good dead man, Nathan.

212
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,948
And what is a good dead man,
Mr. Perfect?

213
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:36,412
A dead man who accepts past actions
and present consequences.

214
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,417
After all, you don't know
what's behind that door.

215
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,048
Looking at it, it doesn't
make me want to be curious.

216
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,966
Fuck you and your lessons in morality!

217
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,802
You shouldn't talk to me this way.

218
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,806
You've already run me over.
You owe me an apology.

219
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,898
OK, I'm sorry.

220
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,319
But I didn't see you.

221
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,948
Right.

222
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,200
No hard feelings.

223
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,249
To tell you the truth,
I wasn't paying attention either.

224
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,169
I was distracted by a little girl
playing at the side of the road.

225
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,970
What do we say at times like this?

226
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,599
Godspeed?

227
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,685
Not funny.

228
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,979
Good luck, then.

229
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,849
It's not working.

230
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,610
I don't understand.

231
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,872
Well, well...

232
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,583
Mr. Moralizer...

233
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,712
...any dirty little secrets
you haven't shared?

234
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,173
I don't understand.
I can't hear the music anymore.

235
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,509
Where are my parents?

236
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,692
No.

237
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,403
Are you the man on the motorcycle
who ran into me?

238
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,992
What? I don't think so.

239
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,204
Are you the little girl who was playing
at the side of the road?

240
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,499
I got lost,
I'm looking for my mom.

241
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,377
- This can't be happening.
- What did you do?

242
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,339
I don't know, I thought I avoided her.

243
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,424
Everything is alright.

244
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,802
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,429
It was a friend's birthday,
I had a few drinks.

246
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,058
You killed an innocent child.

247
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,353
You're a fine one to talk!

248
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,563
My situation was different!

249
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,482
- It was for her own good!
- For her own good?

250
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,527
Her own good earned you
a pretty nice life insurance payout!

251
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,656
- How do you know that?
- The dead know everything!

252
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,450
Why... Why is he saying that?

253
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,044
What's your name, darling?

254
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,462
Alice.

255
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,298
That's a beautiful name.

256
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,758
That's it!

257
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,011
Now I can hear
those damned screams, too!

258
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,391
I'm screwed.
I'm going to hell, too.

259
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,893
Stop with your whining!

260
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,980
I'm trying to make amends
for your stupidity here.

261
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:32,773
Sweetheart.

262
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,944
You're gonna come with me.

263
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,700
We're gonna go to a beautiful place,
and everything's gonna be alright. Come.

264
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,120
I can't go with people I don't know,
and I don't know you.

265
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,458
It's true that you don't know me,
but we won't go very far.

266
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,084
We...

267
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,920
We're just gonna walk through that door.
Can you hear the music?

268
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,966
- Yes.
- I'd never done anything wrong before.

269
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,260
This is not fair!

270
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,678
It was an accident.

271
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,514
It's murder and you know it.
You were drunk!

272
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,810
Come with me. We'll follow the music
and go through that door.

273
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,480
You'll see, on the other side
you'll be reunited

274
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,982
with your dad, your mom,
your sister, your cat, everyone.

275
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,192
Come!

276
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,612
Calm down, sweetheart.
Calm down.

277
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,824
Why are you screaming?
I'm not going to eat you.

278
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,244
You're both going to hell
for what you've done to me!

279
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,790
I had nothing to do with this.

280
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,833
I'm a victim, just like you.

281
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,379
That's enough!

282
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,470
No! No! No!

283
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,393
That was radical.

284
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,479
What? We'd had enough, no?

285
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,988
So what now?

286
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,907
What do you mean?

287
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,534
You think we have a choice?

288
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,750
Not really.

289
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,133
After you.

290
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,761
You go first.

291
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,240
Can you hear the screams now?

292
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,159
Drop it.

293
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,538
If you'd let me go through the other door
when I heard the music,

294
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,456
I wouldn't be here.

295
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,917
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, right.

296
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,015
It's really sadistic, making us
go through of our own accord.

297
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,559
- Don't you think?
- Yes.

298
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,396
I would have preferred
to be forced to enter.

299
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,483
Yes, well...

300
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,818
No!

301
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,595
She wanted to die. She...

302
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,641
She was depressed.
She hated her life!

303
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,478
Ask her.

304
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,564
All I did was help her
get what she wanted.

305
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,277
I don't deserve to rot in hell!

306
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,659
Right.

307
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,244
I get it.

308
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,085
You preach forgiveness
and redemption

309
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,339
but the slightest mistake
gets us the cane!

310
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,548
It's the same old story.

311
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,759
Do as I say and not as I do.

312
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,224
Well, I'm not going!

313
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,856
I don't want to.

314
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,400
Well?

315
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,036
OK, OK. I'm going.

316
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,962
We can't go on like this!

317
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,421
We need help!

318
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,508
We need protection!

319
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,884
She needs us!

320
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,929
Do you hear me?
She needs us.

321
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,640
You're not thinking straight!

322
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,608
You're her father
and you're scared of her!

323
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,822
You have no balls.
You're a coward!

324
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,031
Are you blind?

325
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,245
I won't let her down,
do you understand?

326
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,873
I won't let her down either.
She needs help!

327
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,066
Fight for your daughter!

328
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,404
You can help her!

329
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,323
I spend my life doing that!

330
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:06,495
You wish she didn't exist,
so you could leave!

331
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,373
You never considered her
to be your daughter!

332
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,875
You should be ashamed,
saying that to me!

333
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,462
I only ever have
her best interests at heart.

334
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,588
You think she's happy?

335
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,799
For God's sake,
she's only nine years old!

336
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,509
You're good for nothing!

337
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,304
She just needs your help
after what's happened, and love!

338
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,515
She's not like other girls.

339
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,225
When will you see it?

340
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,852
You're meant to be her father
and you're afraid of her!

341
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,474
How are you doing, Jeanne?

342
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,063
We need to talk, OK?

343
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,401
Can you tell me
what happened yesterday?

344
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,283
I found baby birds.

345
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,203
I wanted to feed them.

346
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,122
And that's what you did?

347
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,540
Yes.

348
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,043
I gave them crumbs from my cookies.

349
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,420
What happened next, Jeanne?

350
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,465
The mother bird returned to the nest.

351
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,134
She was flying around me.

352
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,219
Was she afraid for her babies?

353
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,679
Yes.

354
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,222
What then, Jeanne?

355
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,684
Then,

356
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,562
I took them in my hands
and strangled them.

357
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,190
It was easy.

358
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,984
Have you ever poked people with pens?

359
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,572
Who?

360
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,407
My little sister.

361
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,579
Why were you hurting your sister?

362
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,208
Because I hate her and she's stupid.

363
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,921
Who else did you want to hurt?

364
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,840
Dad and Mom.

365
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,929
Were they scared of you?

366
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,139
Yes.

367
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,016
Have you ever hurt them?

368
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,226
Yes.

369
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,396
When?

370
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,398
At night, when they were asleep.

371
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,983
After that,
they locked me in my room.

372
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,450
What you did to your sister
is very wrong.

373
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,453
Do you realize that?

374
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,205
Can you tell me
what you did to her?

375
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,999
Jeanne?

376
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,626
Can you tell me?

377
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,072
Breakfast!

378
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:41,793
Breakfast! Breakfast! Breakfast!

379
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,561
Tony?

380
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,026
Tony, where are you?

381
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,781
Come on!

382
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,659
I know what you did.
You don't have to hide.

383
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,247
I made you strawberry toast,
the way you like it.

384
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,458
Come out!

385
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,670
Come out or I'll lock you up
and throw away the key

386
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,715
and no one will come to feed you.

387
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,511
Come on.

388
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,939
What did you do?

389
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,274
Nothing.

390
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,650
Yes, you did!

391
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,653
What about Dad and Mom?

392
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,238
It wasn't me.

393
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,199
Who was it, then?
There's only you, Claire, and me here.

394
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,452
How are we going to manage now?

395
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,413
I don't know.

396
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,041
You should have thought
about that before.

397
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,501
Come on, sit down.

398
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,518
Thank you.

399
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,271
But it wasn't me.

400
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,231
Stop saying that!

401
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,406
What's my name?

402
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,160
Not now.

403
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,787
Yes, now.

404
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,375
Tony. Tony the Monster.

405
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,959
Yes.

406
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,711
Yes!

407
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,465
Tony the Monster.

408
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,425
I like it when you say my name.

409
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,136
There's no point hiding
in the magic cave anymore.

410
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,097
Really?

411
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,100
Yes, silly!
They can't see you anymore.

412
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,103
I'll be allowed upstairs?

413
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,774
For real?

414
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,527
Are you deaf? I just told you!

415
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,154
And don't pretend it's the first time.

416
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,533
You had to go upstairs to kill them.
I'm not stupid.

417
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,619
I'm happy to be able to go upstairs.

418
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,705
Thank you.

419
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,291
Well, come on.

420
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,971
You know I'm a little girl, right?

421
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,057
And a little girl needs
her dad and her mom.

422
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,267
I know.

423
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,814
Well, in the meantime
they are dead.

424
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,693
You're a real pain in the ass!

425
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,285
It's wonderful!

426
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,788
Is the weather nice?

427
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,416
I don't know.
But this is no time for sunbathing.

428
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,752
I've never seen the sun.

429
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,129
That can wait.

430
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,089
First you must wash.

431
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,175
You stink!

432
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,343
Come with me.

433
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,347
Undress yourself.

434
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,478
Now...

435
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,939
...I can do whatever I want.

436
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,112
If I want to be a princess, I can.

437
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,034
If I want, I can do this.

438
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,047
What should I do now?

439
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,216
Get in there.

440
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,735
And now what should I do?

441
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,030
Is it always gonna be like this?

442
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,867
"What should I do?
Should I do this? Should I do that?"

443
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,994
It's boring!

444
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,082
I don't know what to do.

445
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,042
I've never done this before.

446
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,336
You turn on the taps.

447
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,142
It's wonderful.

448
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,937
You got it now?

449
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,148
It's amazing.

450
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,614
Take some soap and scrub yourself.

451
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,884
I never want to come out again.

452
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,136
You have to.

453
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,096
We need to tidy up the house.

454
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,615
You didn't hold back.

455
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,034
I told you, it wasn't me.

456
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,660
Not that again!

457
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,372
What's that?

458
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,999
It's grenadine.

459
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,542
Can I have a sip?

460
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,169
No.

461
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,093
Please.

462
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,262
You're so annoying.

463
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,106
I don't like it.

464
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,650
Good!

465
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,824
We can't leave them like this.

466
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,242
What do we do?

467
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,244
We need to tidy up.

468
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,537
Tidy what up?

469
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,790
Them.
We can't leave them there.

470
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,750
We have to put them somewhere.

471
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,210
Where should we put them?

472
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,545
I don't know. I'm thinking.

473
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,424
We could put them under the bed?

474
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,011
Yes, that's not a bad idea.

475
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,555
You take Mom and I'll take care of Dad.

476
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,524
I can't lift him. He's too heavy.

477
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,902
I'll bring him later.

478
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,237
Wait.

479
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,739
We can't just tidy them away like that.

480
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,450
First, we're gonna give them a surprise.

481
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,202
What kind of surprise?

482
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,645
Do you know what happened to me?

483
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,273
This morning I woke up

484
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:09,193
and went downstairs as usual
to get my breakfast.

485
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,611
I come to the table.

486
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,156
I wait and I wait

487
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,199
and nobody comes to serve me.

488
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,909
Absolutely nobody!

489
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,620
They leave me to starve to death.

490
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:28,713
Do you know
why I had nothing but cereal?

491
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,549
No! Tell us! Tell us!

492
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,262
Because my parents were dead!

493
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:41,893
Right!

494
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:45,605
They were lying in a pool of blood,
full of holes.

495
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,609
I didn't understand,
because I knew I hadn't killed them.

496
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,779
Although I did have a moment of doubt.

497
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,991
So I carried out an investigation.

498
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,243
And do you know what I found?

499
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,411
No.

500
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,788
Do you know?

501
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,165
No, we don't!

502
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,666
I found this!

503
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,882
Yeah, a big, fat monster
was hiding in my cellar,

504
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,718
and he killed my dad and my mom.

505
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,179
Tell them you killed them,
ugly, fat monster!

506
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,597
Tell them!

507
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,602
I don't remember.

508
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,687
You do remember!

509
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:30,066
You're just scared of being punished.

510
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,110
No.

511
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,195
I have no recollection of my life

512
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,739
before you picked me up
in the magic cave.

513
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,244
I don't remember having ever existed.

514
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,627
You're talking nonsense.

515
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,880
Do you know the punishment
for big fat lying monsters?

516
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,924
What about you? Do you know?

517
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,468
We hang them! To the scaffold!

518
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,098
Exactly!

519
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,519
Climb up on that.

520
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,118
What's my name?

521
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,328
Tony the Monster.

522
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,717
Any last words
before your execution?

523
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,970
I am Tony the Monster.

524
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,930
And I'm innocent!

525
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,840
Say, I'm getting hungry.

526
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,010
When do we eat?

527
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,346
Do you know how to cook?

528
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,473
Uh... no.

529
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,391
Neither do I.

530
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,185
Except for toast.

531
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,604
I like toast.

532
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,151
Put her down
and push her under the bed.

533
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,237
Alright.

534
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,168
Do you want me to go get Dad?

535
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,587
Yes, please.

536
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,089
Will you wait for me?

537
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,967
- Yes.
- OK. I'll be going then.

538
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,389
<i>I am a princess</i>

539
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,894
<i>I can do whatever I want</i>

540
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,940
And what do I do now?

541
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,403
You do as we say.
You put him under the bed.

542
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,078
I'm beautiful, don't you think?

543
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,580
Yes, you are.

544
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,165
I'm lucky to be so beautiful.

545
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,792
All the girls in my class want to be me.

546
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,045
They are all so jealous.

547
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,757
Why can't I see myself?

548
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,176
Because it's best
if you don't see yourself, Tony.

549
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,635
It's better this way.

550
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,270
Wait!
Wait for me.

551
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,626
What do we do now?

552
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,294
I don't know. Shall we leave?

553
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,797
Yes, we should go somewhere,
but where?

554
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,757
I don't know anywhere.

555
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,974
My aunt lives on a farm
300km from here.

556
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,185
She might help us.

557
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,187
Is 300km far away?

558
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,564
I don't know.

559
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,942
But I think so.

560
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,075
Who is it?

561
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,327
- I don't know.
- You want me to go?

562
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,037
No, stay here.

563
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:52,847
Yes, what is it?

564
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,015
Is your mummy in?

565
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,103
No, she's not here.

566
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,273
Is your daddy in?

567
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,569
No, he's not here either.

568
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,070
Right.

569
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,948
I have a delivery for Mrs. Jacobs.
That's your mom, right?

570
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,533
Yes.

571
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,661
Could you fetch the person
who takes care of you?

572
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,663
Please.

573
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,999
I'm all alone at the moment.

574
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,544
Aren't you too young to be left alone?

575
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:28,174
Well, I'm not really alone, I'm with Tony.

576
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,177
Tony? Alright.

577
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,054
Tony it is, then.

578
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,806
Can you call him, please?

579
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,351
I don't think it's a good idea.

580
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,437
Of course it's a good idea.

581
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,355
I have this package to deliver.

582
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,484
And I need an adult to sign for it.
Do you understand?

583
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,446
Are you sure?

584
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,991
You don't want your mom to have
to collect it from the depot, do you?

585
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,827
Call Tony, sweetheart.

586
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,663
Alright. Tony?

587
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,374
Tony?

588
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,710
Tony!

589
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,962
This may be a gift for you.

590
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,715
Tony!

591
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,841
Listen, young lady,

592
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,261
isn't it time you changed your clothes
and washed your hands?

593
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,306
You are covered in I don't know what.

594
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,725
It's strawberry jam. Tony!

595
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,228
Look, I have work to do.

596
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,856
Here is the missed-delivery card.

597
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:26,982
Tony!

598
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,985
And the address of the depot.

599
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,030
Tony?

600
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,698
Tony!

601
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,242
Tony?

602
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,536
Tony!

603
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,038
Tony?

604
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,206
Tony!

605
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:46,252
Tony? Tony!

606
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,879
Stop hiding. It's not funny.

607
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,005
Tony!

608
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,633
Tony!

609
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,843
Tony, this isn't funny!

610
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,973
Tony!

611
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,307
Tony!

612
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,059
Tony!

613
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,565
Tony?

614
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:11,944
Tony!

615
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,863
Where are you? Tony!

616
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,415
Tony!

617
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,375
Tony!

618
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,337
Don't look at me! Go away!

619
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,548
Stop it!

620
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,079
Claire.

621
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,751
Why isn't Mom coming?

622
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,839
Because she's dead.

623
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,391
Did you kill her?

624
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,856
Tony killed her.

625
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,908
Is he going to kill me, too?

626
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,412
Yes.

627
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:30,791
Can I please finish my drawing first?

628
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:34,586
No.

629
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,130
Tony is hungry.

630
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,577
You'll be fine in there.

631
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,922
Get in there.
You won't feel a thing.

632
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,683
<i>Fire department</i>

633
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,144
<i>The house is burning</i>

634
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,646
<i>Fire department</i>

635
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,982
<i>The house has burned down</i>

636
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,151
<i>It was not me who burned it</i>

637
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,612
<i>It was the cooking lady</i>

638
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,739
<i>It was not me who burned it</i>

639
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,574
<i>It was the cooking boy</i>

640
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,615
Chloe?

641
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:06,006
Chloe, I don't want to leave too late.

642
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,258
I don't want us to get stuck in traffic.

643
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,928
Hurry up, please.

644
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,601
Chloe, can you hear me?

645
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,627
Chloe?

646
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,979
Chloe.

647
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:08,235
We can't leave half an hour late
every morning.

648
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:16,493
I need time
to drop you off and then...

649
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:21,456
...I have to go to the garage
and then I have to go to work.

650
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,834
Come on.

651
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,939
You know, I was thinking...

652
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,652
...maybe we should go away
for a weekend together.

653
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,531
What do you think?

654
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,502
A hotel...

655
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,966
...with a view of the sea, a small room.

656
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,595
By the beach.

657
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,722
Enjoy being pampered.

658
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,310
What do you think?

659
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,691
It was just an idea.

660
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:39,321
I was thinking we should spend
more time together, but it's...

661
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,991
...up to you.

662
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,368
You don't have to.

663
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,291
Wait, I'll be back.

664
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,300
Chloe, don't give me a hard time
this morning, OK?

665
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,509
Do you hear?

666
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,680
Chloe, do you hear me?

667
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,648
No fuss this morning.

668
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:19,402
I have a difficult case in court.
Dry yourself, get dressed, and let's go.

669
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,862
Alright?

670
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,573
Alright.

671
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,785
Can you please leave?

672
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,371
OK, but hurry up.

673
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,122
Stop.

674
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:34,000
Who was there that day?
You perhaps? No.

675
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,878
Yes, you've already told me this
dozens of times

676
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,422
and it's always the same.

677
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,633
You tell me the same thing every time!

678
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,177
Princess! Princess! Princess!

679
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,493
Talk! Tell me! Explain!

680
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,079
But that's nonsense.
That's not what happened.

681
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,583
You should have thought
about it before.

682
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,336
Well, yes, she's here.

683
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,714
But that's not how it happened.

684
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,173
We've talked about this.

685
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,927
It's not you, it's me.

686
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,680
Nonsense! You're a joke.

687
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,767
You know this is wrong.
This is nonsense!

688
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,238
What is it now, Chloe?
What's going on?

689
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:49,451
I can't put up with this every morning.
I have a schedule, too.

690
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,703
I don't want to go.

691
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:01,004
Listen, every day
I have to deal with schizophrenics,

692
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:03,173
alcoholics who beat their wives,

693
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,216
thieves who stole scooters,
dealers...

694
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:08,219
Do you think I want to go?
No, but I go anyway.

695
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,097
You don't understand.

696
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,934
I've had enough.

697
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,645
I can't take it anymore.

698
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,398
You don't know
what I'm going through.

699
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,361
What's going on here?

700
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:26,571
Tell me.

701
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,449
I'm listening.

702
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,370
It's not going well.

703
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:35,205
Not going well at all.

704
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,874
That's because you started
in the middle of the year.

705
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:41,127
Give yourself some time,
and you'll be fine. You'll see.

706
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:44,672
I'm going through hell.

707
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,467
Aren't you overreacting a little bit?

708
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,970
We've all been there.

709
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,764
You just need time to adjust.

710
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,058
Toughen up a bit and you'll be fine.

711
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,060
Do you want me to talk to Mr. Vallon?

712
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,731
Things will change, you'll see.
I promise it'll be OK.

713
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,484
Come on.

714
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,694
Let's go, because
I'm really gonna be late now.

715
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,821
Come on.

716
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,890
OFFICE

717
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,291
Get out!

718
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,627
Get out! Get out!

719
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:58,806
Come on, let's go away together.
We'll leave now. We needn't tell anyone.

720
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:03,478
We won't call the school. Fuck them!

721
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,315
What do you say?
Let's go away together right now.

722
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,650
Let's do it!

723
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,610
And who cares about Jacques?

724
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,820
Fuck him as well!

725
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,447
Fuck them all!

726
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,074
We'll go away together.

727
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,493
I know a little place on a clifftop.

728
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,912
It's beautiful, and...

729
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:24,123
there is a lighthouse
that guides lost boats at night.

730
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,626
And...

731
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:38,471
At this time of year it will be quiet,
which will make things easier.

732
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:42,976
I won't take many clothes,
just one or two things.

733
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,936
At any rate...

734
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:53,778
We should have done this ages ago.
I'm sorry I've neglected you.

735
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,656
I was too engrossed in my work.

736
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:03,663
But now we'll make up
for lost time, right?

737
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,206
It's still possible.

738
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,636
I may not have always been there,
but that doesn't mean I don't love you.

739
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,313
I love you with all my heart.

740
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,443
Chloe?

741
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:44,996
Chloe.

742
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:47,957
With all my heart.

743
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,589
It doesn't matter about school.

744
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:55,882
I can teach you.

745
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:59,052
We'll look up the syllabus
and I'll help you.

746
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:05,224
You'll never have to go back.

747
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,101
I promise.

748
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,522
No more school.

749
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,277
Where did I put the keys?

750
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,805
Help! Help!

751
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,223
Shut up! No one is coming!

752
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,350
Open the door
or we'll break it down!

753
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,479
Don't think you're all that,
you dirty slut!

754
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,358
You won't escape
through the shithole, so open up!

755
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,902
Stop it. I'll open the door.

756
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,822
Fucking open it, then!
The longer you wait, the worse it gets!

757
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,741
We won't do anything to you,
just beat you up a bit!

758
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:07,578
Why are you picking on me?
I didn't do anything to you!

759
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,290
You think you're a star,
but we'll bring you down to earth!

760
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,625
It's for your own good.

761
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,502
You'll thank us later.

762
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,087
There's no point talking to her.

763
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,382
She's too stupid to understand.
Open up, bitch!

764
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:28,474
Alright. I'll open the door.

765
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,404
Come on, get out!

766
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,657
I didn't do anything.

767
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,909
We don't care!

768
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,370
You're not at Mom and Dad's house now.

769
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,038
You are not the queen here.

770
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:54,667
- But I don't see myself as the queen.
- Prove it, then!

771
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:58,296
Get down on your knees like a bitch
and kiss our feet!

772
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,339
On your knees!

773
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:03,468
We're gonna take a few pictures
for the school's Facebook page.

774
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:07,138
So everyone can see
that you are our slave now.

775
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:11,017
Please, I'd like to go home.

776
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:14,145
If you don't kiss her feet,
you'll never see home again!

777
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,981
And give us a smile
or we'll shave your head.

778
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:24,030
Do you want me to cut
that pretty princess face?

779
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,740
Kiss her feet, then!

780
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,618
I said smile!

781
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,413
Come on! Smile more!

782
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,755
Are you alright?

783
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,347
There were bricks.

784
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,473
Bricks?

785
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,977
Forget it.

786
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:03,194
You screamed.

787
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,447
You're not having a stroke, are you?

788
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,991
You seem absent. Are you alright?

789
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,827
Yes, sorry.

790
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:12,578
I was dreaming.

791
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,749
We have to go now.
We are in a hurry.

792
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,334
OK.

793
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,338
Hello, Chloe!

794
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,840
How are you?

795
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:26,259
Aren't you going to say hello
to your favorite neighbor?

796
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,720
What happened?
She had an accident?

797
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,139
No, no, she's doing fine.

798
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,852
We need to leave now.
We are going on vacation.

799
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,229
On vacation?

800
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,648
In the middle of the school year?

801
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,024
Are you alright?

802
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:44,735
Yes, I'm good.

803
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,281
You're acting weirdly, Julia.

804
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:49,407
I swear.

805
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:54,203
If you have a problem,
if there is anything I can do,

806
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,913
I'm right next door.

807
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,165
I know, Emma.

808
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,418
Well...

809
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:03,004
have a good holiday, then.

810
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,635
There's something
you're not telling me.

811
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,637
I know her. She's not well.

812
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:14,390
- We really must...
- Julia, tell me what's going on.

813
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:16,726
Nothing.

814
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,811
Excuse me! Chloe.

815
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,610
Chloe.

816
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:57,099
I remember when you were born,
you were so small.

817
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,352
So fragile.

818
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,107
I was sure you wouldn't last the night.

819
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,403
But then you did.

820
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:13,407
And then another day and another day.

821
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,122
And then I watched you grow up.

822
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:26,671
And I saw you become strong,
become beautiful.

823
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,215
And then...

824
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,929
...I stopped seeing you.

825
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:38,683
And I forgot this fragile life
that had come out of me.

826
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,814
But it will all work out.

827
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,567
We need to take some time
for ourselves.

828
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,198
We need to rest.

829
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,245
We'll dress up
and go to the best restaurants.

830
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,540
Eat large platters of seafood.

831
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:05,292
They say sea air is good for us.

832
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,754
No?

833
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,091
Isn't that what they say?

834
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:19,932
Answer me, please.

835
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:23,978
Answer me.

836
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,646
Answer me.

837
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:26,856
Please.

838
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,357
Please answer me.

839
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:32,570
Please. Please.

840
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,178
Let go of the wheel!

841
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,679
Let go of the wheel!

842
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,224
Let go of the wheel.

843
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:45,976
Let go of the wheel.

844
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,735
Get out!

845
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,155
Come on!

846
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,286
Let go of me!

847
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:12,962
Come on, calm down.

848
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,178
- I want my daughter!
- Calm down.

849
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,429
I want my daughter!

850
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,559
We've all been there.

851
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,933
I will be your guide.

852
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:33,686
Please follow me, Nathan.

853
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,116
Where am I?

854
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,450
What do you think?

855
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,538
And you are?

856
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,166
I am nobody.

857
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:01,171
I accompany souls
to their eternal torment.

858
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,758
Really?

859
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:09,179
All this is not enough?

860
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,724
We have to endure it forever.

861
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:15,477
Yeah, sure. Why not.

862
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,062
It depends on your wrongdoing.

863
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:20,774
But most of the time
it is eternity that awaits you.

864
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,735
You know what I did.

865
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:27,323
She had an advanced stage
of multiple sclerosis.

866
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:29,783
It's not murder.

867
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,252
Did she ask you to do it?

868
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:43,047
No. She was in agony.
It made her lose her mind.

869
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,676
I am not here to judge.

870
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:50,596
I am only participating
in the execution of the sentence.

871
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:53,057
Where are my judges?

872
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:57,353
Who listened to what I had to say?
I loved my wife.

873
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:58,687
I don't belong here.

874
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:01,732
This is a mistake!
I want to talk to the person in charge!

875
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,567
There is no one to listen to you.

876
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:08,489
There is no other place than here.

877
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:11,325
After death there is only hell.

878
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:16,872
Humanity is evil by nature
and must atone for its sins.

879
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,625
Follow me, Nathan.

880
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:30,803
Whatever we do, we are condemned
to suffer here until the end of time?

881
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:33,389
For most of you, yes.

882
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,766
But here time has no end.

883
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,812
One suffers forever, remembering
with nostalgia one's earthly life.

884
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:40,979
Great.

885
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:43,107
So where do we start?

886
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:46,026
Do I get my balls ripped off,
my eyes gouged out?

887
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,491
Delightful idea, but no.

888
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,036
You will go through the first circle
in semi-isolation

889
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:58,914
until you forget the memory
you have of your body.

890
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:04,169
You will become a pure spirit
of pain and despair.

891
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:07,381
Quite frankly...

892
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:09,591
...I don't like you.

893
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,678
And I don't like what you're saying.

894
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:15,305
If you're looking to scare me,
you've succeeded.

895
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:18,559
- Please.
- After you.

896
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:21,937
It's protocol.

897
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:26,984
Really?

898
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:50,048
No, no, no, no.
That's not gonna be possible.

899
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,510
I'm not going to be able
to take this forever.

900
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,554
It's what we do here.

901
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,640
Make you endure the unbearable
and make sure it never stops.

902
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:01,393
You'll see, you'll never get used to it.

903
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,524
Is there nothing but despair here?

904
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:10,486
Nothing for you anyway, I'm afraid.

905
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,825
Well, on that note, let me explain.

906
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,869
You are here in quarantine.

907
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,622
- You will be confined in...
- No, not again!

908
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,665
40 days here? No way!

909
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:29,379
No, a quarantine here corresponds
to 40 of your centuries,

910
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,256
4,000 years if you prefer.

911
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,803
What do you mean 4,000 years?

912
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,140
You still think like a human.

913
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:42,267
And, indeed, it can seem long.

914
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:47,606
But 40 centuries is not much
compared to what awaits you afterwards.

915
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:53,612
It's ridiculous.
It's completely disproportionate!

916
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:56,073
- It makes no sense.
- Let me finish.

917
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,741
At the end of your quarantine,

918
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:02,579
the process of shattering all recollection
of your being will be completed.

919
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,499
You will have no other function
than to suffer.

920
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,085
You are totally mad.

921
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,047
Flattery will get you nowhere.

922
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,717
I will come and get you
at the end of your quarantine.

923
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,179
See you soon, Nathan.

924
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:46,206
I won't be able to endure this
for 4,000 years. I'm telling you now!

925
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,787
Who's here? What's going on?

926
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:39,968
Who are you?

927
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,388
Nathan. And you?

928
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:46,683
Billy. Are you my new toy?

929
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:49,353
No. I don't think so.

930
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:52,439
Yes, you are. You look like a toy
so you're my toy.

931
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,899
No, no, I'm not your toy, Billy!

932
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:55,609
Yes, you are!

933
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,237
OK, don't get mad!

934
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:00,656
What do you want to play?

935
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,240
I want to beat you up!

936
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:04,576
Beat me up? No.
Don't you want to play something else?

937
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:07,621
- No!
- How about I think of someone

938
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:09,373
and you have to guess who?

939
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,087
Wake up!

940
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,344
What did I do?

941
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:24,740
We're losing souls
because of you, Billy.

942
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:32,247
He was not intended for reincarnation.

943
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:43,258
You let a damned soul
return to an earthly life.

944
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,142
You created an Antichrist!

945
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,743
Tomorrow, your body
will have grown back.

946
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:10,869
Go and bring him back.

947
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:14,331
I will find his soul, Norgül,
no matter what his new body is.

948
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:17,334
I will find him, I promise,
and I will bring him back here.

949
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,753
Sorry. I beg your forgiveness.

950
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,630
Hell has no mercy!
